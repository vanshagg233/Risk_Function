All safety drivers are trained to manage potential hazards they may encounter on the roads and are encouraged to retake control of the vehicle whenever necessary to ensure safe operation.  
Here, the Plus vehicle was traveling Northbound on [XXX] at approximately 63 mph in mild to moderate traffic with clear weather conditions.  According to the video camera log, the truck was in autonomous mode when a black SUV traveling in the right-most driving lane swerved to the right into the emergency lane (i.e., the shoulder) to avoid a vehicle that had stopped before it in the driving lane. Seeing the disabled vehicle in the driving lane, the Plus Safety Driver took control of the truck by applying the brakes and began to decelerate the vehicle. Two vehicles traveling behind the black SUV in the same lane then swerved to the left and into the lane in which the Plus vehicle was traveling.  The left side of the second of these vehicles (a minivan) made contact with the Plus truck's right side. [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
The Plus truck swerved slightly into the lane to its left as a result of the contact, avoiding a pickup truck that was passing by it. The Safety Driver then re-centered the vehicle into the truck's original lane. After the contact, the minivan moved into the rightmost lane and then ultimately came to a stop in the emergency lane.

A Police report was taken at the scene, but the Plus Safety Driver did not receive a copy of it.

After the light turned green, the Zoox vehicle proceeded straight towards [XXX]. While nearly through the intersection, the cyclist abruptly veered left into the path of the Zoox vehicle and accelerated toward the front of the Zoox vehicle in violation of a red crosswalk signal and in violation of the Zoox vehicle's right-of-way.

The eBike laterally impacted the Zoox vehicle's right front fender and body side, then the cyclist impacted the right front body of the Zoox vehicle. The Zoox vehicle then came to a full stop. The cyclist then rode over to the sidewalk and remained briefly stopped on the sidewalk before getting back on the eBike and riding away. The Zoox vehicle cleared the intersection, then pulled over on [XXX], and shortly after was towed from the scene for inspection. The Zoox vehicle sustained minor damage to the right front body.

On March [XXX], 2025 at 9:52 PM CDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in Austin, Texas was in a collision involving a pickup truck on [XXX] near [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling east on [XXX] and preparing for a right turn into a parking lot on the south side of [XXX] for a pick up. Two pedestrians approached the Waymo AV at the entrance to the parking lot, resulting in the Waymo AV remaining stationary in the rightmost lane of [XXX]with its hazard lights activated. After stopping, the ADV reversed briefly in an attempt to make progress toward the pick up location. As the two pedestrians attempted to enter the Waymo AV, the pedestrians remained in close proximity to the vehicle, which inhibited the Waymo AV's progress. While the Waymo AV remained stopped, a pickup truck traveling east on [XXX] in the rightmost lane approached the Waymo AV. The pickup truck began braking as it neared the Waymo AV. The front passenger side of the pickup truck then made contact with the rear driver side of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV made contact with one of the pedestrians who was standing to the right of the Waymo AV, who fell to the ground to the right of the Waymo AV and then returned to a standing position. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.

Almost immediately after rolling the curb, the vehicle began to drift right in lane, rubbing the vehicle sidewall on a curb. The test driver intervened immediately, but not before the sidewall of the rear right tire was weakened. Later during the drive while under manual control, the sidewall fails, eventually leading to a low pressure indicator illuminating in the dash. It was discovered that the deployment of map files, which must remain compatible, was incomplete, leaving a mismatch in the system. This resulted in the vehicle having an incorrect estimate of where lanes are in the coordinates of our localization map, and as a result, the vehicle had an incorrect estimate of proximity to lane boundaries, resulting in curb strikes.",

May's vehicle was traveling at approximately 20 MPH in a residential neighborhood, and was approximately 1m left of lane center when a black vehicle exited a driveway on the right from behind a fence, facing the road and May's vehicle. This vehicle did not slow down or stop until entering into the roadway and collided with the May vehicle's right side. AVO attempts to swerve to the left but is unable to avoid a collision. 
The primary factor that led to the collision was the other vehicles action proceeding without the right-of-way into the side of the May vehicle. Upon further inspection, it was determined that we did not predict this collision until it was too late to avoid it even by veering. The velocity of the other vehicle was underestimated and was largely given only yield policies as having the most significant likelihood. There is some room for improvement in our response, which we plan to implement in future software releases, namely, an emergency veer policy must exist that is capable of moving quickly and far enough to possibly avoid the collision, more accurate reporting of velocity for slow-moving agents, estimate acceleration when assessing risk, improvements to predictions of the probability of an agent yielding, and adjusting our risk assessment so that it is heading dependent and more risk would be associated with passing close in front of another vehicle.",

While the traffic light remained red, the Waymo AV reversed approximately one car length at a low rate of speed then slowed to a stop. When the traffic light ahead of the Waymo AV turned green and the Waymo AV remained stopped, a pickup truck that had pulled up behind the Waymo AV changed lanes into the left adjacent lane to maneuver around the Waymo AV, making contact with the rear driver side corner of the Waymo AV.

The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on [XXX] approaching [XXX] when a passenger car, exiting a shopping complex, made contact with the rear passenger end of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV initially detected the passenger car and yielded for the passenger car to allow it to turn onto [XXX]. Instead of turning onto [XXX] immediately, the passenger car creeped forward very slowly indicating that it intended to yield to the Waymo AV and make way for a cyclist passing by on the sidewalk. The Waymo AV determined the passenger car would yield based on its behavior and because the Waymo AV had the right of way and the passenger car needed to make way for a passing cyclist. The Waymo AV then proceeded past the passenger car. When the Waymo AV was positioned directly in front of the passenger car, the passenger car accelerated out of the shopping center exit and drove into the rear passenger side of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.

The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane of two northbound lanes on [XXX] near the intersection with [XXX] when it encountered the scene of a prior collision between a passenger car and an SUV. The two vehicles were stopped in the rightmost lane. The Waymo AV came to a stop behind the passenger car and a queue of traffic in the left lane began passing the scene. While the Waymo AV was stopped, occupants of the SUV and the passenger car exited their vehicles, apparently to inspect damage and/or exchange information. The Waymo AV detected these pedestrians and began yielding to them while attempting to plan a passing maneuver to clear the scene. Shortly after the pedestrians exited their vehicles, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left followed by a passenger car that had been stopped behind the SUV. As the passenger car initiated its passing maneuver, a heavy truck passing the scene in the left lane made contact with the drive side of the passenger car. The impact between the heavy truck and the passenger car caused the passenger side of the passenger car to make contact with the rear left corner of the stopped Waymo AV.

The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane of two northbound lanes on [XXX] near the intersection with [XXX] when it encountered the scene of a prior collision between a passenger car and an SUV. The two vehicles were stopped in the rightmost lane. The Waymo AV came to a stop behind the passenger car and a queue of traffic in the left lane began passing the scene. While the Waymo AV was stopped, occupants of the SUV and the passenger car exited their vehicles, apparently to inspect damage and/or exchange information. The Waymo AV detected these pedestrians and began yielding to them while attempting to plan a passing maneuver to clear the scene. Shortly after the pedestrians exited their vehicles, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left followed by a passenger car that had been stopped behind the SUV. As the passenger car initiated its passing maneuver, a heavy truck passing the scene in the left lane made contact with the drive side of the passenger car.

As the Waymo AV approached the intersection and came to a stop, a passenger car which was following behind the Waymo AV at a low rate of speed approached the Waymo AV from behind and partially crossed into the right-hand travel lane. The passenger car continued proceeding slowly forward until the front of the passenger car made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. After contact occurred, the passenger car remained in contact with the rear of the Waymo AV, and several bystanders approached the passenger car, attempting to communicate with the driver. Once the traffic light turned green, the Waymo AV proceeded through the intersection and pulled over at the curb on the south side of the intersection to avoid obstructing other traffic. While the Waymo AV proceeded through the intersection, the passenger car continued to roll forward into the intersection, and was stopped by several bystanders.

The road was characterized by light traffic, with a slight curvature that transitioned from a gentle rightward sway to a leftward sway. As the vehicle navigated this transition of curvature, the May vehicle made contact with the curb, causing a flat tire. 
At the time of the incident, no other vehicles or pedestrians were present in the immediate vicinity, and there were no external factors such as obstructions or adverse weather conditions influencing the vehicles path.
Speed was reduced from 30mph to 25mph after this event and tested (and worked to mitigate the problem in that area) and now will be reduced to 22 which is the sweet spot for most areas on the route. The May vehicle chose to maneuver at the curb due to perceived risk from a car in an adjacent lane, so May is increasing the allowed distance to the curb to mitigate how close the vehicles are allowed to get.",

On February [XXX], 2024 at 2:34 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a bicyclist on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The cyclist had entered the 4-way stop intersection without stopping or yielding. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and the bicyclist reported minor injuries and damage to their bicycle. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear, resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and to our knowledge, the bicyclist reported only minor injuries. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds.

There are no other changes to Cruise's previous submission (30412-6395-3): A Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on southbound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.",Y

A Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on southbound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.

The BCC later informed LYNX dispatch at 12:49PM that the second shuttle operating on route, P131, would also be returning to storage after the operator completed its current loop. At Approximately 12:52 PM, P131 approached the [XXX] stop within the designated Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) operating lane. The shuttle remained stopped for approximately two (2) and a half minutes while three (3) passengers alighted, and two (2) additional passengers boarded the shuttle. During that period, approximately two (2) minutes after stopping to service passengers, a LYNX bus pulled behind P131. Approximately thirty (30) seconds later, the LYNX bus exited the BRT lane and proceeded into the public travel lane alongside the BRT lane. As the LYNX bus entered the public travel lane, the safety driver onboard P131 engaged the autonomous drive system, and the shuttle proceeded in the BRT lane. After both vehicles had begun moving, P131 in the BRT lane and the LYNX bus in the public travel lane, the LYNX bus reentered the BRT lane encroaching on the shuttles path. The bus failed to provide adequate clearance and contacted the left front side of P131. Both vehicles stopped in the BRT lane after the collision. 
Within five (5) minutes of the collision, all passengers had safely alighted from the shuttle with no reported injuries and left the scene without giving statements. At approximately 2:20PM, the City of Orlando Police Department (OPD) arrived on scene to investigate the incident. Beep and LYNX supervisors were on scene to support the investigation. OPD collected statements from both the Beep safety driver and LYNX bus driver. The LYNX supervisor provided OPD access to the LYNX bus camera footage on scene, at which point the investigating officer made a verbal indication that the LYNX bus driver appeared to be at fault for the collision. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug and alcohol screening. 
1.The safety driver did not exhibit complete situational awareness and per their after-incident interview, failed to notice the bus prior to departing the station. Had the attendant continued to look and check behind/alongside P131 prior to departing the station,
the collision may have been avoided.
2.The safety driver attempted to stop the shuttle by disengaging the ADS using the HMI rather than using the emergency stop button. Use of the emergency stop would have increased the deceleration rate to 5 m/s2, decreasing the stopping distance of the shuttle. However, it is not clear whether use of the emergency stop would have fully avoided the collision given the point at which the LYNX LYMMO bus entered the BRT lane.
3.Deficiencies in the standard operating procedures (SOP) between LYNX and Beep allowed for a bus to be deployed onto the service at the same time as P131. Beep communicated to LYNX that both shuttles were exiting the service area. However, LYNX did not wait for final confirmation that both vehicles had left the route prior to dispatching the LYMMO bus involved in the incident, nor did LYNX notify Beep that a bus had been dispatched.

At approximately 5:54 p.m. on Wednesday, August [XXX], 2023, P84, travelling eastbound on [XXX], approached the three-way stop at [XXX] and [XXX]. P84 arrived at the intersection at the same time as two other vehicles: a grey van heading northbound on [XXX] and a red sedan heading westbound on [XXX]. The safety driver yielded to the northbound vehicle, which proceeded to make a right-hand turn eastbound onto [XXX]. After allowing the intersection to clear, the safety driver onboard P84 confirmed that it was safe for the shuttle to proceed through the intersection. As the shuttle entered the intersection, a second vehicle travelling northbound on [XXX], a white sedan, entered the intersection intending a left-hand turn onto westbound [XXX]. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, subsequently colliding at a low rate of speed in the middle of the intersection.  
At approximately 5:57 p.m., the Beep Command Center (BCC) was informed by the safety driver that P84 was involved in a minor collision with another vehicle at the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX]. The incident response protocol was initiated, and a supervisor dispatched to the scene. Local law enforcement (San Francisco Police Department) was contacted to report the collision but declined to respond given the minor nature of the collision, directing both parties to exchange information. After the Beep supervisor arrived on scene at approximately 6:49 p.m., the safety driver and supervisor removed the shuttle from the roadway and exchanged insurance information with the driver of the other vehicle. 
Damage to both vehicles was noted to be very minor. The shuttle sustained light scuffs, chips, and small paint transfer. The other vehicle sustained a small dent on the fender. Neither vehicle required towing, and both were safely driven from the scene. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug & alcohol screening which has since cleared.  
Contributing Factors 
Based on an analysis of the available evidence, Beep has determined the following factors may have contributed to the higher likelihood of a collision occurring in this instance: 
1.The white sedan failed to yield to P84 in accordance with California state law governing intersection priority.
2.The slight bend in P84s path to accommodate the lane shift through the intersection may have reduced the available stopping distance as the white sedan was not perceived as an obstacle in P84s path until it proceeded further into the intersection.
Incident Findings 
Beep developed the following findings regarding this incident:
1.P84 behaved as expected, detecting and maintaining awareness of the white sedan in the moments preceding the collision, commanding hard braking maneuver, and achieving a 3m/s2 deceleration rate once the white sedan encroached on P84s path.
2.The safety driver observed California state law and had the right of way when releasing P84 into the intersection.
3.The safety driver could have avoided the collision by using the emergency stop. The safety driver indicated that they were aware of the other vehicle through the duration of the incident and were aware of the proper procedure in this scenario but panicked in the moment.
Mitigation:
Implement a priority zone to account for the slight bend in the shuttles path and for future vehicles that may fail to yield.",

On August [XXX], 2023 at 6:11 PM PT, a Waymo AV operating in San Francisco, California was stopped at a red light in the dedicated left turn lane on the left side of northeast-bound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. While the light was red, a fire engine approached the Waymo AV from behind and the Waymo AV moved forward as far as possible before entering the intersection at [XXX]. After the light turned green and as the Waymo AV was calculating a path into the intersection to clear the way, the fire engine maneuvered around the Waymo AV on the right side. During this maneuver, the right side of the fire engine appears to have made contact with the front left corner of an SUV that was stopped in the through lane to the right of the Waymo AV. The fire engine then proceeded through the intersection, and shortly afterwards, another fire engine and a fire department SUV passed on the left side the Waymo AV of the stopped Waymo AV. The Waymo AV then proceeded through the intersection.
At the time of the collision, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The SUV sustained damage.

Traffic slowed quickly, apparently due to a crash ahead of the Ghost car.  Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control of the car by manually braking and disengaging the autonomous system.  The car was traveling 55.3 mph when the driver began to brake.  The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car.  A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car.  Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over.  To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured.  The Ghost drivers heard a noise and then found that the rear bumper of the Ghost car had been damaged, which Ghost believes resulted from crash debris.

As the Waymo AV was braking and had slowed to 3 mph, a passenger vehicle behind the Waymo made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. Moments later, an SUV behind the passenger vehicle made contact with the rear of the passenger vehicle. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. All vehicles sustained damage. Rather than wearing the seat belt, the passenger in the Waymo AV was sitting on the buckled seat belt at the time of the collision.

As such, this event could have qualified for a 5-Day report. The narrative below has been updated to reflect this information. This updated report also now lists the Highest Injury Severity Alleged as moderate, and Transdev Alternative Services as an entity that may be aware of this incident.
On [XXX], 2023 at 1:17 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, AZ was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] in the southbound direction near the [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane (out of 5 lanes) in the southbound direction of [XXX],  and the left 3 lanes were closed due to a work zone. The vehicle traveling ahead in the same lane as the ADV made an abrupt lane change to the left, revealing a stack of slow-moving vehicles in the Waymo AVs lane. The test driver of the Waymo AV took manual control of the vehicle and started to decelerate and steer toward the right shoulder in response to slow traffic ahead. A passenger vehicle approached the Waymo AV from behind and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver (in the drivers seating position) was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode.

The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s.

On April [XXX], 2023 at 10:46 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling southbound on [XXX] in the leftmost lane as it was approaching the intersection with [XXX].  The signal for traffic proceeding south on [XXX] was green for the Waymo AV as it approached the intersection.  As the Waymo AV approached, an individual riding a motorized scooter traveling north on [XXX] proceeded to turn left onto westbound [XXX], across the paths of the Waymo AV and other oncoming vehicles.  The Waymo AV began to brake, and the Waymo AV test driver transitioned to manual mode and brought the Waymo AV to a stop.  A passenger car traveling directly behind the Waymo AV then made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV.  The individual riding the scooter was not contacted by the Waymo AV or any other vehicle.

The Waymo AV began to brake, and the Waymo AV test driver transitioned to manual mode and brought the Waymo AV to a stop. A passenger car traveling directly behind the Waymo AV then made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. The individual riding the scooter was not contacted by the Waymo AV or any other vehicle. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both the Waymo AV and the passenger car sustained damage, and the individual on the motorized scooter left the scene. 
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because a Vulnerable Road User was involved. Waymo may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available.",

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.

While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

On September [XXX], 2022 at 1:13 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ( Waymo AV ) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision involving two passenger cars on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic at a red light facing West on [XXX]. The passenger car immediately behind the Waymo AV slowed and came to a near stop when a second passenger car approaching from behind made contact with the rear of the first passenger car, causing that car to make contact with the rear of the Waymo AV.
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver's seating position). All three vehicles sustained damage.

TuSimple's position is that this event does not meet the criteria for reporting under the SGO.
Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.
However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been
attempted to be activated. In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to
prevent human error from repeating this event.
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to
veer left. The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left
front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.",

The Beep shuttle attendant was traveling Southbound on [XXX] at approx 7-12 mph in ADS and headed towards the intersection of [XXX]. Beep vehicle stopped at red light at intersection. As the Beep vehicle was crossing the intersection in manual and slowing to a stop to return to ADS in a southbound direction, the trailing bus made light contact with its bicycle rack to the Beep shuttle rear end. The trailing vehicle is a bus owned and operated by the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA). According to video, as reported by the shuttle attendant and the PSTA Road Supervisor, the bus was tailgating.

The May vehicle passed too close to a parked vehicle, causing the May vehicle's passenger-side mirror to contact the parked vehicle's driver-side mirror.
The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.  
 
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.  However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been attempted to be activated.  In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.  
 
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to prevent human error from repeating this event.
 
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to veer left.  The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.  
 
The contact resulted in a scuff to the left tire and damage to the radar unit extending from the left quarter panel.",

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. 
UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX]. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.
UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.

On September [XXX], 2021 at 1:54 PM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ('Waymo AV') operating in Tempe, AZ was in a collision involving a pickup truck on [XXX] near [XXX]. While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV began to enter the right lane of a protected double left turn lane (""Lane 2"") from northbound [XXX] to westbound [XXX]. A pickup truck heading southbound on [XXX] had completely crossed the double-yellow lines of the northbound double left turn lanes and positioned itself in the left lane of the double turn lane (""Lane 1"") facing the wrong direction against traffic and was preparing to make a left turn across Lane 2 and the other two northbound lanes into a shopping center parking lot on the east side of [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in Lane 2 when the pickup truck began to initiate its left turn from Lane 1. The Waymo AV braked, and the trained human driver in the Waymo AV (in the driver's seating position), transitioned the vehicle from autonomous to manual mode. As the pickup truck made the left turn, the driver's side panels of the pickup truck made contact with the driver's side rear corner of the Waymo AV causing moderate damage to the Waymo AV. Damage to the pickup is currently unknown. At the time of contact, the Waymo AV was in manual mode.
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because the Waymo AV was towed from the scene.
