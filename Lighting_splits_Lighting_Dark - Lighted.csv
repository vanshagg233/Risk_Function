The Waymo AV began passing the double-parked vehicles on the left, but as it did so the queue of double-parked vehicles began to proceed.

A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.",Y

A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.
