On March [XXX], 2025 at 9:52 PM CDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in Austin, Texas was in a collision involving a pickup truck on [XXX] near [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling east on [XXX] and preparing for a right turn into a parking lot on the south side of [XXX] for a pick up. Two pedestrians approached the Waymo AV at the entrance to the parking lot, resulting in the Waymo AV remaining stationary in the rightmost lane of [XXX]with its hazard lights activated. After stopping, the ADV reversed briefly in an attempt to make progress toward the pick up location. As the two pedestrians attempted to enter the Waymo AV, the pedestrians remained in close proximity to the vehicle, which inhibited the Waymo AV's progress. While the Waymo AV remained stopped, a pickup truck traveling east on [XXX] in the rightmost lane approached the Waymo AV. The pickup truck began braking as it neared the Waymo AV. The front passenger side of the pickup truck then made contact with the rear driver side of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV made contact with one of the pedestrians who was standing to the right of the Waymo AV, who fell to the ground to the right of the Waymo AV and then returned to a standing position. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.

Shortly after the pedestrians exited their vehicles, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left followed by a passenger car that had been stopped behind the SUV. As the passenger car initiated its passing maneuver, a heavy truck passing the scene in the left lane made contact with the drive side of the passenger car.

On February [XXX], 2024 at 2:34 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a bicyclist on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The cyclist had entered the 4-way stop intersection without stopping or yielding. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and the bicyclist reported minor injuries and damage to their bicycle. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear, resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and to our knowledge, the bicyclist reported only minor injuries. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear resumed driving for a short period of time.

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.
