Customer contacted Kia Customer Care (KCC) to report an incident involving his 2023MY Kia Sportage. Specifically, the customer called to thank Kia ""for saving [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] life."" Customer explained he was in a head-on collision when a drunk driver suddenly veered into his lane.  Customer reported he suffered ""cuts, bumps & bruises"" and stated he ""believes that [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] lack of injuries is due to the plethora of safety features my Sportage had.""  KCC subsequently contacted the customer to obtain additional details regarding the incident.  Customer stated that he was driving on a two-lane highway around 3AM, with cruise control engaged, when the car he was following veered into a ditch and a drunk driver veered into his lane. Customer did not see the drunk driver until the last second and as a result did not have time react.  When asked by KCC, the customer responded that Highway Driving Assist (HDA) was not engaged, but that his Smart Cruise Control and Lane Following Assist were engaged at the time of the incident.  The customer reported that the Sportage's airbags deployed, both the customer and driver of the other vehicle (unclear if the drunk driver or the driver of the vehicle that veered into the ditch) were transported to the hospital and that the Sportage was towed. Customer stated he was not asking anything from Kia and that he had called only to share his appreciation. 
This incident is being reported as precautionary measure since the incident meets the requirements under the SGO.  However, based on the description of the incident provided by the customer, the incident was not caused by a failure and/or disengagement of smart cruise control and/or LFA.

Customer reported he suffered cuts, bumps & bruises and stated he believes that [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] lack of injuries is due to the plethora of safety features my Sportage had.   KCC subsequently contacted the customer to obtain additional details regarding the incident.  Customer stated that he was driving on a two-lane highway around 3AM, with cruise control engaged, when the car he was following veered into a ditch and a drunk driver veered into his lane. Customer did not see the drunk driver until the last second and as a result did not have time react.  When asked by KCC, the customer responded that Highway Driving Assist (HDA) was not engaged, but that his Smart Cruise Control and Lane Following Assist were engaged at the time of the incident.  The customer reported that the Sportages airbags deployed, both the customer and driver of the other vehicle (unclear if the drunk driver or the driver of the vehicle that veered into the ditch) were transported to the hospital and that the Sportage was towed. Customer stated he was not asking anything from Kia and that he had called only to share his appreciation. 
This incident is being reported as precautionary measure since the incident meets the requirements under the SGO.  However, based on the description of the incident provided by the customer, the incident was not caused by a failure and/or disengagement of smart cruise control and/or LFA.",
