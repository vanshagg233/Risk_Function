The vehicle exited the sub-lot and rolled over a curb. The vehicle stopped at a stop sign at the exit of the main lot. As it proceeded to turn onto the main road, it rolled over another curb. Almost immediately after rolling the curb, the vehicle began to drift right in lane, rubbing the vehicle sidewall on a curb. The test driver intervened immediately, but not before the sidewall of the rear right tire was weakened. Later during the drive while under manual control, the sidewall fails, eventually leading to a low pressure indicator illuminating in the dash. It was discovered that the deployment of map files, which must remain compatible, was incomplete, leaving a mismatch in the system. This resulted in the vehicle having an incorrect estimate of where lanes are in the coordinates of our localization map, and as a result, the vehicle had an incorrect estimate of proximity to lane boundaries, resulting in curb strikes.",

As the vehicle navigated this transition of curvature, the May vehicle made contact with the curb, causing a flat tire. 
At the time of the incident, no other vehicles or pedestrians were present in the immediate vicinity, and there were no external factors such as obstructions or adverse weather conditions influencing the vehicles path.
Speed was reduced from 30mph to 25mph after this event and tested (and worked to mitigate the problem in that area) and now will be reduced to 22 which is the sweet spot for most areas on the route.

At 11:01 am, while running the normal route, the Olli contacted the adjacent curb on the front right side, causing tie rod and cosmetic damage. No one was injured and the only damage was to the vehicle itself. The customer contacted RRAI through the client support portal shortly after the incident. No injuries occurred, there were no passengers besides the safety operator, no other vehicles were involved, and no emergency systems were engaged.
Olli 2.0 (S/N 2-18) is an 8-passenger shuttle that is no longer manufactured. The vehicle manufacturer, Local Motors, dissolved in 2022. Local Motors contracted RRAI to install autonomy kits for several Olli shuttles during the period of 2018 - 2020. RRAI provided some support for initial site deployment and ensured customer safety operators were trained on the autonomy system. Since the Local Motors dissolution in 2022, almost all Olli vehicles have been decommissioned.
To date, we have concluded the following:
1. There were no updates or alterations made by RRAI in the months prior to Jan [XXX]. In previous operations, including the immediately preceding operations on January 20th, 2023, Olli 2-18 ran the route as normal with no anomalies. There were no software updates or other system changes before it was run again on January [XXX], 2023, the date of curb contact.
2. The root cause of the curb contact was a communication error with the HD Map registration module. HD Map registration utilizes real-time lidar and positioning data and compares that to a-priori HD maps stored within the autonomy system. A communication problem occurred between the computer running the map registration software and the computer running the navigation algorithms. The cause for the communication problem has been identified and a fix has been implemented to prevent the issue from happening again (see below).
3. Steering was out of calibration. It was noted through data collection that the steering was out of calibration at time of incident. The autonomy system was attempting to correct this issue, but the vehicular steering system could not achieve the required turn radius. This is a vehicular maintenance concern managed by the customer.
It was determined that the HD map registration issue had not been observed during autonomous operations in the previous four years. The solution to prevent further occurrences includes:
1. Implementing a self-diagnostic routine upon system boot, which ensures the communication connection is established. If the connection is not established, this diagnostic will prevent the vehicle from driving autonomously. 
2. Updating the error checks to ensure that during run time, the vehicle will come to a controlled stop in event of a communication problem.  
3. Working with the customer to recalibrate the steering, and assisting in reviewing customer's vehicle maintenance checks for steering calibration if necessary.
4. Continuing to review data to determine other concerns or improvements.",
