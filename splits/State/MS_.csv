The shuttle was operating under a valid permission as documented in the change letter dated September [XXX], 2024. 
Traveling Southbound on [XXX], P139 stopped at the three-way intersection just north of the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX]. After the operator cleared the shuttle to proceed through the intersection under automated control, a trailing white sedan made contact at low speed with the rear of P139, having failed to come to a complete stop behind the shuttle. P139 continued through the intersection before stopping at the [XXX] stop station. The white sedan turned onto [XXX] and left the scene. 
There was one passenger onboard at the time of the incident. They were uninjured and alighted the shuttle without concern at the [XXX] stop station. P139 was removed from service for inspection. The shuttle sustained minor cosmetic damage.",
