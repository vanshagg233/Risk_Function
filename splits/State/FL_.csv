The BCC later informed LYNX dispatch at 12:49PM that the second shuttle operating on route, P131, would also be returning to storage after the operator completed its current loop. At Approximately 12:52 PM, P131 approached the [XXX] stop within the designated Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) operating lane. The shuttle remained stopped for approximately two (2) and a half minutes while three (3) passengers alighted, and two (2) additional passengers boarded the shuttle. During that period, approximately two (2) minutes after stopping to service passengers, a LYNX bus pulled behind P131. Approximately thirty (30) seconds later, the LYNX bus exited the BRT lane and proceeded into the public travel lane alongside the BRT lane. As the LYNX bus entered the public travel lane, the safety driver onboard P131 engaged the autonomous drive system, and the shuttle proceeded in the BRT lane. After both vehicles had begun moving, P131 in the BRT lane and the LYNX bus in the public travel lane, the LYNX bus reentered the BRT lane encroaching on the shuttles path. The bus failed to provide adequate clearance and contacted the left front side of P131. Both vehicles stopped in the BRT lane after the collision. 
Within five (5) minutes of the collision, all passengers had safely alighted from the shuttle with no reported injuries and left the scene without giving statements. At approximately 2:20PM, the City of Orlando Police Department (OPD) arrived on scene to investigate the incident. Beep and LYNX supervisors were on scene to support the investigation. OPD collected statements from both the Beep safety driver and LYNX bus driver. The LYNX supervisor provided OPD access to the LYNX bus camera footage on scene, at which point the investigating officer made a verbal indication that the LYNX bus driver appeared to be at fault for the collision. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug and alcohol screening. 
1.The safety driver did not exhibit complete situational awareness and per their after-incident interview, failed to notice the bus prior to departing the station. Had the attendant continued to look and check behind/alongside P131 prior to departing the station,
the collision may have been avoided.
2.The safety driver attempted to stop the shuttle by disengaging the ADS using the HMI rather than using the emergency stop button. Use of the emergency stop would have increased the deceleration rate to 5 m/s2, decreasing the stopping distance of the shuttle. However, it is not clear whether use of the emergency stop would have fully avoided the collision given the point at which the LYNX LYMMO bus entered the BRT lane.
3.Deficiencies in the standard operating procedures (SOP) between LYNX and Beep allowed for a bus to be deployed onto the service at the same time as P131. Beep communicated to LYNX that both shuttles were exiting the service area. However, LYNX did not wait for final confirmation that both vehicles had left the route prior to dispatching the LYMMO bus involved in the incident, nor did LYNX notify Beep that a bus had been dispatched.

While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

The vehicle was a company vehicle (owned by Polestar Automotive USA) driven by a company employee, with no known modifications to the factory hardware condition or software updates or changes not released to the public. Subject vehicle was traveling around a curve on the freeway interchange at approximately 55mph, recommended speed in that portion of exchange was 50mph.  Driver looked down and took attention off the road.  The vehicle continued slightly straight, running up and grazing off the concrete barrier, before coming back into the lane.  The vehicle's rear suspension, rear and front wheel/tire were damaged. Vehicle was towed from the scene. We have recovered data from the vehicle and are currently reviewing what information was stored for the incident and will update this report.
10 Day update: After review of the EDR data the technical team was able to determine the following: Pilot Assist was disengaged due to the lateral acceleration exceeded the system limit and the available steering torque system input exceeding the limit.  The vehicle could not steer enough to follow the lane. Several warnings were issued: visually in the DIM (Drivers Information Module, display), haptically in the steering wheel, before Pilot Assist was disengaged. The driver is always responsible for ensuring that the vehicle is driven in a safe manner. The driver failed to take control of the vehicle when the vehicles Pilot Assist gave the warnings.",

The Beep shuttle attendant was traveling Southbound on [XXX] at approx 7-12 mph in ADS and headed towards the intersection of [XXX]. Beep vehicle stopped at red light at intersection. As the Beep vehicle was crossing the intersection in manual and slowing to a stop to return to ADS in a southbound direction, the trailing bus made light contact with its bicycle rack to the Beep shuttle rear end. The trailing vehicle is a bus owned and operated by the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA). According to video, as reported by the shuttle attendant and the PSTA Road Supervisor, the bus was tailgating.
