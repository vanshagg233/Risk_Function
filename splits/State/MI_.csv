As the vehicle proceeded through its turn, it encountered exhaust fumes from vehicles waiting at a stoplight in the adjacent lane. Due to environmental conditions and sensor limitations, the vehicle's lidar system interpreted the exhaust plume as a solid object in its path. In response, the autonomous vehicle first tried to adjust its position. When this maneuver proved insufficient, the system initiated a hard stop response. The vehicle behind, which was following at approximately 7-8 meters, was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the autonomous vehicle. The collision occurred at relatively low speeds (the autonomous vehicle had decelerated from approximately 7.6 m/s to 0 m/s), though exact impact speeds of the following vehicle were not recorded. The primary factor that led to this incident is that Lidar does not pierce through exhaust so the exhaust cloud appears to be a large, solid object. Some corrective actions that will be implemented: consider weather implication in future platform sensor selection and continue working on the software to improve a neural network to classify lidar points, which will use temporal information, radar, and camera features to make a decision on whether a lidar point is truly an object.",

Customer contacted Kia Customer Care (KCC) to report an incident involving his 2023MY Kia Sportage. Specifically, the customer called to thank Kia ""for saving [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] life."" Customer explained he was in a head-on collision when a drunk driver suddenly veered into his lane.  Customer reported he suffered ""cuts, bumps & bruises"" and stated he ""believes that [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] lack of injuries is due to the plethora of safety features my Sportage had.""  KCC subsequently contacted the customer to obtain additional details regarding the incident.  Customer stated that he was driving on a two-lane highway around 3AM, with cruise control engaged, when the car he was following veered into a ditch and a drunk driver veered into his lane. Customer did not see the drunk driver until the last second and as a result did not have time react.  When asked by KCC, the customer responded that Highway Driving Assist (HDA) was not engaged, but that his Smart Cruise Control and Lane Following Assist were engaged at the time of the incident.  The customer reported that the Sportage's airbags deployed, both the customer and driver of the other vehicle (unclear if the drunk driver or the driver of the vehicle that veered into the ditch) were transported to the hospital and that the Sportage was towed. Customer stated he was not asking anything from Kia and that he had called only to share his appreciation. 
This incident is being reported as precautionary measure since the incident meets the requirements under the SGO.  However, based on the description of the incident provided by the customer, the incident was not caused by a failure and/or disengagement of smart cruise control and/or LFA.

A vehicle behind the AV was traveling approximately the same speed as the May shuttle. The May AV began to slow for an object ahead. Due to weather conditions, the AV misclassified a speed limit sign as a pedestrian, which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the AV. This caused the May AV to apply additional braking to avoid the projected collision with the misclassified object. The following vehicle did not react promptly when the May AV started to slow down, resulting in the following vehicle braking too late to avoid collision and impacting the May AV from behind.  The following vehicle then pulled around the May vehicle and drove away.  Resimulation of this event with an upcoming software version shows that the May AV would not misidentify the non-exist object so would not have decelerated unnecessarily. This improved software is set to be deployed to the full commercial fleet soon. In addition, per May policy, the commercial fleet would not operate in weather conditions like those present in this incident.",

The following vehicle was traveling approximately twice as fast as the May shuttle and catching up to the May shuttle from behind. The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s. Re-simulation of this event with a future software version shows that the May shuttle would have decelerated less abruptly.",
