After the light turned green, the Zoox vehicle proceeded straight towards [XXX]. While nearly through the intersection, the cyclist abruptly veered left into the path of the Zoox vehicle and accelerated toward the front of the Zoox vehicle in violation of a red crosswalk signal and in violation of the Zoox vehicle's right-of-way.

The eBike laterally impacted the Zoox vehicle's right front fender and body side, then the cyclist impacted the right front body of the Zoox vehicle. The Zoox vehicle then came to a full stop. The cyclist then rode over to the sidewalk and remained briefly stopped on the sidewalk before getting back on the eBike and riding away.

May's vehicle was traveling at approximately 20 MPH in a residential neighborhood, and was approximately 1m left of lane center when a black vehicle exited a driveway on the right from behind a fence, facing the road and May's vehicle. This vehicle did not slow down or stop until entering into the roadway and collided with the May vehicle's right side. AVO attempts to swerve to the left but is unable to avoid a collision. 
The primary factor that led to the collision was the other vehicles action proceeding without the right-of-way into the side of the May vehicle. Upon further inspection, it was determined that we did not predict this collision until it was too late to avoid it even by veering. The velocity of the other vehicle was underestimated and was largely given only yield policies as having the most significant likelihood. There is some room for improvement in our response, which we plan to implement in future software releases, namely, an emergency veer policy must exist that is capable of moving quickly and far enough to possibly avoid the collision, more accurate reporting of velocity for slow-moving agents, estimate acceleration when assessing risk, improvements to predictions of the probability of an agent yielding, and adjusting our risk assessment so that it is heading dependent and more risk would be associated with passing close in front of another vehicle.",

On October [XXX], 2024 at 9:04 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane of two northbound lanes on [XXX] near the intersection with [XXX] when it encountered the scene of a prior collision between a passenger car and an SUV. The two vehicles were stopped in the rightmost lane. The Waymo AV came to a stop behind the passenger car and a queue of traffic in the left lane began passing the scene. While the Waymo AV was stopped, occupants of the SUV and the passenger car exited their vehicles, apparently to inspect damage and/or exchange information. The Waymo AV detected these pedestrians and began yielding to them while attempting to plan a passing maneuver to clear the scene. Shortly after the pedestrians exited their vehicles, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left followed by a passenger car that had been stopped behind the SUV. As the passenger car initiated its passing maneuver, a heavy truck passing the scene in the left lane made contact with the drive side of the passenger car. The impact between the heavy truck and the passenger car caused the passenger side of the passenger car to make contact with the rear left corner of the stopped Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. All three vehicles sustained damage.

The Waymo AV was traveling eastbound on [XXX] and approached the intersection where westbound [XXX] merges with southbound [XXX]. The Waymo AV entered the intersection on a green light but traffic in the intersection slowed to a stop, resulting in a lack of space ahead for the Waymo AV to proceed completely through the intersection.

On February [XXX], 2024 at 2:34 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a bicyclist on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The cyclist had entered the 4-way stop intersection without stopping or yielding. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and the bicyclist reported minor injuries and damage to their bicycle. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear, resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop.

Another vehicle (the ""lead"" car) entered into the Ghost car's lane from the right. While there were numerous vehicles ahead of the Ghost car before that vehicle entered the lane, the lead vehicle blocked the view of the lane before it. Throughout the incident, traffic in the other three lanes continued at a steady pace.
When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds. The Ghost car was able to match the rapid speed reduction of the lead car and avoid contact.
The driver following the Ghost car was not able to respond as quickly as the Ghost ADS. When the following driver began to apply the brakes, the car was about five meters behind and was traveling at 6.5 mps. At the point of impact, the Ghost vehicle was traveling at 4.78 mps (10.7 mph), matching the lead car. There were no injuries. The vehicles suffered only cosmetic damage, the drivers exchanged information, and the Ghost safety drivers returned to home base in conventional mode.",

A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.",Y

A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.

At approximately 5:54 p.m. on Wednesday, August [XXX], 2023, P84, travelling eastbound on [XXX], approached the three-way stop at [XXX] and [XXX]. P84 arrived at the intersection at the same time as two other vehicles: a grey van heading northbound on [XXX] and a red sedan heading westbound on [XXX]. The safety driver yielded to the northbound vehicle, which proceeded to make a right-hand turn eastbound onto [XXX]. After allowing the intersection to clear, the safety driver onboard P84 confirmed that it was safe for the shuttle to proceed through the intersection. As the shuttle entered the intersection, a second vehicle travelling northbound on [XXX], a white sedan, entered the intersection intending a left-hand turn onto westbound [XXX]. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, subsequently colliding at a low rate of speed in the middle of the intersection.  
At approximately 5:57 p.m., the Beep Command Center (BCC) was informed by the safety driver that P84 was involved in a minor collision with another vehicle at the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX]. The incident response protocol was initiated, and a supervisor dispatched to the scene. Local law enforcement (San Francisco Police Department) was contacted to report the collision but declined to respond given the minor nature of the collision, directing both parties to exchange information. After the Beep supervisor arrived on scene at approximately 6:49 p.m., the safety driver and supervisor removed the shuttle from the roadway and exchanged insurance information with the driver of the other vehicle. 
Damage to both vehicles was noted to be very minor. The shuttle sustained light scuffs, chips, and small paint transfer. The other vehicle sustained a small dent on the fender. Neither vehicle required towing, and both were safely driven from the scene. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug & alcohol screening which has since cleared.  
Contributing Factors 
Based on an analysis of the available evidence, Beep has determined the following factors may have contributed to the higher likelihood of a collision occurring in this instance: 
1.The white sedan failed to yield to P84 in accordance with California state law governing intersection priority.
2.The slight bend in P84s path to accommodate the lane shift through the intersection may have reduced the available stopping distance as the white sedan was not perceived as an obstacle in P84s path until it proceeded further into the intersection.
Incident Findings 
Beep developed the following findings regarding this incident:
1.P84 behaved as expected, detecting and maintaining awareness of the white sedan in the moments preceding the collision, commanding hard braking maneuver, and achieving a 3m/s2 deceleration rate once the white sedan encroached on P84s path.
2.The safety driver observed California state law and had the right of way when releasing P84 into the intersection.
3.The safety driver could have avoided the collision by using the emergency stop. The safety driver indicated that they were aware of the other vehicle through the duration of the incident and were aware of the proper procedure in this scenario but panicked in the moment.
Mitigation:
Implement a priority zone to account for the slight bend in the shuttles path and for future vehicles that may fail to yield.",

On August [XXX], 2023 at 6:11 PM PT, a Waymo AV operating in San Francisco, California was stopped at a red light in the dedicated left turn lane on the left side of northeast-bound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. While the light was red, a fire engine approached the Waymo AV from behind and the Waymo AV moved forward as far as possible before entering the intersection at [XXX]. After the light turned green and as the Waymo AV was calculating a path into the intersection to clear the way, the fire engine maneuvered around the Waymo AV on the right side. During this maneuver, the right side of the fire engine appears to have made contact with the front left corner of an SUV that was stopped in the through lane to the right of the Waymo AV. The fire engine then proceeded through the intersection, and shortly afterwards, another fire engine and a fire department SUV passed on the left side the Waymo AV of the stopped Waymo AV. The Waymo AV then proceeded through the intersection.
At the time of the collision, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The SUV sustained damage.

Traffic slowed quickly, apparently due to a crash ahead of the Ghost car.  Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control of the car by manually braking and disengaging the autonomous system.  The car was traveling 55.3 mph when the driver began to brake.  The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car.  A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car.  Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over.  To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured.  The Ghost drivers heard a noise and then found that the rear bumper of the Ghost car had been damaged, which Ghost believes resulted from crash debris.

Subject vehicle approached a red light to make a right turn East-bound onto [XXX].  The safety operator suggested that the safety driver disengage the ADS and make the turn in manual mode because the vehicle was hesitant in approaching the intersection. The safety driver disengaged the ADS, and, approximately 250ms later, subject vehicle was lightly struck from behind by a white Mazda3.  Having seen debris on the roadway, the driver and operator believed they had run over a rock and did not realize they were hit by the vehicle. After concluding the mission, the driver and operator found damage to a sensor during an inspection.  A subsequent review of video led to discovery of the crash.
