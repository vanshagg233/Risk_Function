Plus's safety drivers are experienced and well-trained. The Safety Driver operating the particular vehicle has 12-years of over-the-road commercial vehicle driving experience. All safety drivers are trained to manage potential hazards they may encounter on the roads and are encouraged to retake control of the vehicle whenever necessary to ensure safe operation.  
Here, the Plus vehicle was traveling Northbound on [XXX] at approximately 63 mph in mild to moderate traffic with clear weather conditions.  According to the video camera log, the truck was in autonomous mode when a black SUV traveling in the right-most driving lane swerved to the right into the emergency lane (i.e., the shoulder) to avoid a vehicle that had stopped before it in the driving lane. Seeing the disabled vehicle in the driving lane, the Plus Safety Driver took control of the truck by applying the brakes and began to decelerate the vehicle. Two vehicles traveling behind the black SUV in the same lane then swerved to the left and into the lane in which the Plus vehicle was traveling.  The left side of the second of these vehicles (a minivan) made contact with the Plus truck's right side. [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
The Plus truck swerved slightly into the lane to its left as a result of the contact, avoiding a pickup truck that was passing by it. The Safety Driver then re-centered the vehicle into the truck's original lane. After the contact, the minivan moved into the rightmost lane and then ultimately came to a stop in the emergency lane.  The Plus Safety Driver changed lanes and also brought the truck to a stop in the emergency lane.
A Police report was taken at the scene, but the Plus Safety Driver did not receive a copy of it.  Based on our best information, none of the passengers in the minivan reported injuries and the only damage was to the vehicle's driver-side tire.  The minivan nevertheless was towed away from the scene.  The Plus truck did not have any damage and was able to continue driving to its destination.",Y

On March [XXX], 2025 at 9:52 PM CDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in Austin, Texas was in a collision involving a pickup truck on [XXX] near [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling east on [XXX] and preparing for a right turn into a parking lot on the south side of [XXX] for a pick up. Two pedestrians approached the Waymo AV at the entrance to the parking lot, resulting in the Waymo AV remaining stationary in the rightmost lane of [XXX]with its hazard lights activated. After stopping, the ADV reversed briefly in an attempt to make progress toward the pick up location. As the two pedestrians attempted to enter the Waymo AV, the pedestrians remained in close proximity to the vehicle, which inhibited the Waymo AV's progress. While the Waymo AV remained stopped, a pickup truck traveling east on [XXX] in the rightmost lane approached the Waymo AV. The pickup truck began braking as it neared the Waymo AV. The front passenger side of the pickup truck then made contact with the rear driver side of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV made contact with one of the pedestrians who was standing to the right of the Waymo AV, who fell to the ground to the right of the Waymo AV and then returned to a standing position.

This incident occurred near Ranger, TX on [XXX]  approximately 9:56 am CT on November [XXX], 2023. The Aurora vehicle was operating in autonomy at the time. Conditions were overcast, with light rain. As the Aurora vehicle was driving in its lane at 67 mph, a Ford pick-up truck overtaking the Aurora vehicle in the rightmost lane at approximately 80 mph appears to have hydroplaned, lost control, and hit the passenger-side rear portion of the trailer. 
Before the collision, the Aurora Driver detected the pick-up truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge to the left to provide space. This was insufficient to completely avoid the collision, and the pickup truck made contact with the passenger side rear of the trailer. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Vehicle Operator received the notification that a collision had been detected and was initiating an incident response. The Vehicle Operator did not visually observe the collision and therefore assumed the reaction of the Aurora Driver to be a software anomaly worth escalated attention, rather than the correct detection of a collision and thus reported the incident through our escalated annotation protocol, rather than through our incident response protocols. We identified the incident at approximately 8:45 am CT on December [XXX], 2023 through a review of our data logs.
At this time, we are not aware of any injuries and, from camera footage, the pick-up truck also appears to have left the scene of the incident. There is also no indication of any cargo or major trailer damage.",

The May vehicle passed too close to a parked vehicle, causing the May vehicle's passenger-side mirror to contact the parked vehicle's driver-side mirror.
The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

On May [XXX], 2022 at 3:11 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) Peterbilt Class 8 semi-truck and trailer, operating in Ennis, Texas was in a collision involving a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer on northbound [XXX] near [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode in the rightmost lane on Interstate [XXX] when a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer began to pass it in the adjacent left lane. Before the adjacent Class 8 semi-truck and trailer had fully passed the Waymo AV, it executed a right lane change and its trailer (the right side, rear section) entered the lane in which the Waymo AV was traveling and made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV cab. The Waymo AV transitioned to manual mode and the test driver took control. The Waymo AV exited the roadway to the right shoulder of the road and came to a stop off of the roadway. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver's seating position). The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage and the third-party Class 8 semi-truck and trailer did not stop to exchange information. The Waymo AV test driver was transported for medical care and the Waymo AV software operator, seated in the passenger seat, later sought medical attention. 
Transdev Alternative Services is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because an individual involved in the crash was transported from the scene to a hospital for medical treatment and a vehicle involved was towed away. Transdev may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available.
