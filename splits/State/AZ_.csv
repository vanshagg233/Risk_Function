The Waymo AV was traveling north on [XXX] when it encountered a queue of double-parked vehicles in the northbound lane. The Waymo AV began passing the double-parked vehicles on the left, but as it did so the queue of double-parked vehicles began to proceed. The Waymo AV began to merge back into the northbound lane, but a vehicle in the queue then double-parked again before the Waymo AV could fully merge back into the northbound lane. The Waymo AV then began reversing to make space for southbound traffic but came to a stop before completing its reversing maneuver to yield to traffic approaching the Waymo AV from the rear.  A passenger car traveling south on [XXX] then crossed the double yellow line to pass the Waymo AV in the northbound lane. As it did so, the rear passenger side of the passenger car made contact with the rear driver side of the Waymo AV. The passenger was not belted at the time, likely because the AV had just departed its pickup location. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The passenger car sustained damage.

The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane (out of 5 lanes) in the southbound direction of [XXX],  and the left 3 lanes were closed due to a work zone. The vehicle traveling ahead in the same lane as the ADV made an abrupt lane change to the left, revealing a stack of slow-moving vehicles in the Waymo AVs lane. The test driver of the Waymo AV took manual control of the vehicle and started to decelerate and steer toward the right shoulder in response to slow traffic ahead. A passenger vehicle approached the Waymo AV from behind and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver (in the drivers seating position) was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV and the other vehicle sustained damage. The test driver reported an injury, for which they later sought medical treatment.

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.

TuSimple's position is that this event does not meet the criteria for reporting under the SGO.
Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.
However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been
attempted to be activated. In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to
prevent human error from repeating this event.
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to
veer left. The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left
front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.",

Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.  
 
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.  However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been attempted to be activated.  In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.  
 
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to prevent human error from repeating this event.
 
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to veer left.  The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.  
 
The contact resulted in a scuff to the left tire and damage to the radar unit extending from the left quarter panel.",
