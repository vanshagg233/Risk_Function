The vehicles internal facing cameras show that the operator started to fall asleep while applying physical input to the steering wheel. The road started to bend to the left. The physical input from the operator was enough to deviate the vehicle from its intended path but not enough to trigger an intervention and take the vehicle out of autonomy. The vehicle, going straight as the road curved, then struck the curb, resulting in minor vehicle damage. Due to the vehicle being off path, the vehicle begins to stop. This occurs as the operator wakes up. The operator was not injured and no third parties were impacted or otherwise affected by the incident. 
The local May Mobility site staff did not notice any signs of fatigue from this operator prior to going out in the vehicle. The operator had responded to audio check-ins from site staff at a regular interval. We are exploring additional risk mitigation options for in-cabin health monitoring, in addition to the existing cameras and radio check-ins.",

As the May shuttle made the turn, the VRUs were traveling in the same direction as the May shuttle on opposite sides of the lane. As the May shuttle completed the turn at 10 MPH, the brakes were applied and the vehicle came to a complete stop because one of the riders attempted to cross over in the lane which caused VRU safety buffer to intersect with vehicle path, which led the vehicle to slow to a stop. The scooter rider contacted the rear left rear bumper of the shuttle. Scooters were traveling at an estimated speed of 12 mph and accelerating.",
