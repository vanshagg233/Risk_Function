A Motional AV was operating in Las Vegas, Nevada, in autonomous mode with a safety driver at the wheel and an engineer in the front passenger seat.
The AV was eastbound on [XXX], approaching the intersection with [XXX], in the furthest left of five lanes (lane one), a dedicated left turn lane.  Another vehicle, originally traveling in a middle through-traffic lane (lane three), had entered lane two, also a dedicated left turn lane, and come to a stop almost perpendicular to the flow of traffic.  As the AV approached the other vehicle began moving from lane two into lane one without signaling.  The safety driver took control, turning the steering wheel to the left to create space from the other vehicle, momentarily bringing the AV's left front wheel onto a median curb before safely returning to the roadway after the AV had passed the other vehicle.
There were no injuries or property damage other than a minor tire scuff.  law enforcement was not involved.",
