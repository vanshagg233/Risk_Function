Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 sustained moderate damages.
After discussing the incident with vehicle 2's driver, they admitted they were attempting to make an upcoming right turn off the expressway. They initiated 2 consecutive right lane changes abruptly before hitting vehicle 1 on their last attempted lane change.
After the initial impact, vehicle 1 was forced out of the initial lane, onto a divide, and ultimately came to a stop on the shoulder of the expressway. At this time both occupants of vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 were able to assess respective damages and exchange information. It was determined that there were no injuries.

Plus's safety drivers are experienced and well-trained. The Safety Driver operating the particular vehicle has 12-years of over-the-road commercial vehicle driving experience. All safety drivers are trained to manage potential hazards they may encounter on the roads and are encouraged to retake control of the vehicle whenever necessary to ensure safe operation.  
Here, the Plus vehicle was traveling Northbound on [XXX] at approximately 63 mph in mild to moderate traffic with clear weather conditions.  According to the video camera log, the truck was in autonomous mode when a black SUV traveling in the right-most driving lane swerved to the right into the emergency lane (i.e., the shoulder) to avoid a vehicle that had stopped before it in the driving lane. Seeing the disabled vehicle in the driving lane, the Plus Safety Driver took control of the truck by applying the brakes and began to decelerate the vehicle. Two vehicles traveling behind the black SUV in the same lane then swerved to the left and into the lane in which the Plus vehicle was traveling.  The left side of the second of these vehicles (a minivan) made contact with the Plus truck's right side. [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
The Plus truck swerved slightly into the lane to its left as a result of the contact, avoiding a pickup truck that was passing by it. The Safety Driver then re-centered the vehicle into the truck's original lane. After the contact, the minivan moved into the rightmost lane and then ultimately came to a stop in the emergency lane.  The Plus Safety Driver changed lanes and also brought the truck to a stop in the emergency lane.
A Police report was taken at the scene, but the Plus Safety Driver did not receive a copy of it.  Based on our best information, none of the passengers in the minivan reported injuries and the only damage was to the vehicle's driver-side tire.  The minivan nevertheless was towed away from the scene.  The Plus truck did not have any damage and was able to continue driving to its destination.",Y

At this time, we are not aware of any injuries, and camera footage appears to show that the box truck continued to drive. From the post-trip inspection, there was not any visible trailer damage. Before the collision, the Aurora Driver was driving straight in its lane and passing the box truck. Shortly thereafter, the box truck began to encroach into the lane of the Aurora Driver. The Aurora Driver detected the box truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge away from the box truck to provide space. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Aurora vehicle then re-engaged in autonomy approximately two minutes later. 
The Vehicle Operator did not visually observe the collision, assumed the reaction of the Aurora Driver to be a software anomaly, and reported the vehicle nudge through the standard annotation protocol rather than through the incident response protocols.

As always, there were two safety drivers in the car. Traffic was moving in all four lanes at or near the speed limit. The Ghost vehicle was in the right-middle lane. Another vehicle (the ""lead"" car) entered into the Ghost car's lane from the right. While there were numerous vehicles ahead of the Ghost car before that vehicle entered the lane, the lead vehicle blocked the view of the lane before it. Throughout the incident, traffic in the other three lanes continued at a steady pace.
When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds. The Ghost car was able to match the rapid speed reduction of the lead car and avoid contact.
The driver following the Ghost car was not able to respond as quickly as the Ghost ADS. When the following driver began to apply the brakes, the car was about five meters behind and was traveling at 6.5 mps. At the point of impact, the Ghost vehicle was traveling at 4.78 mps (10.7 mph), matching the lead car. There were no injuries. The vehicles suffered only cosmetic damage, the drivers exchanged information, and the Ghost safety drivers returned to home base in conventional mode.",

This incident occurred near Ranger, TX on [XXX]  approximately 9:56 am CT on November [XXX], 2023. The Aurora vehicle was operating in autonomy at the time. Conditions were overcast, with light rain. As the Aurora vehicle was driving in its lane at 67 mph, a Ford pick-up truck overtaking the Aurora vehicle in the rightmost lane at approximately 80 mph appears to have hydroplaned, lost control, and hit the passenger-side rear portion of the trailer. 
Before the collision, the Aurora Driver detected the pick-up truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge to the left to provide space. This was insufficient to completely avoid the collision, and the pickup truck made contact with the passenger side rear of the trailer. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Vehicle Operator received the notification that a collision had been detected and was initiating an incident response.

Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control of the car by manually braking and disengaging the autonomous system.  The car was traveling 55.3 mph when the driver began to brake.  The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car.  A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car.  Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over.  To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured.

The Kodiak AV had been braking for over 11 seconds in lane to safely accommodate two pedestrians and their vehicles near the fog line on the shoulder when a pickup truck rear-ended the Kodiak AV. 
The Kodiak AV was operating with a safety driver (in the drivers seating position), who transitioned the vehicle from autonomous to manual mode immediately prior to impact. At the time of impact, the Kodiak AV was in manual mode.
No injuries occurred in the incident. The Kodiak AV's rear lightbar sustained minor damage, as did the pickup trucks front bumper and hood.  Both vehicles were able to drive away from the scene. 
Kodiak is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of the Standing General Order 2021-01 because the Kodiak AV was slowing down for vulnerable road users when it was rear-ended. Kodiak may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available.",Y

TuSimple's position is that this event does not meet the criteria for reporting under the SGO.
Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.
However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been
attempted to be activated. In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to
prevent human error from repeating this event.
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to
veer left. The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left
front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.",

The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode in the rightmost lane on Interstate [XXX] when a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer began to pass it in the adjacent left lane. Before the adjacent Class 8 semi-truck and trailer had fully passed the Waymo AV, it executed a right lane change and its trailer (the right side, rear section) entered the lane in which the Waymo AV was traveling and made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV cab. The Waymo AV transitioned to manual mode and the test driver took control. The Waymo AV exited the roadway to the right shoulder of the road and came to a stop off of the roadway. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver's seating position). The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage and the third-party Class 8 semi-truck and trailer did not stop to exchange information.

The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode in the rightmost lane on Interstate [XXX] when a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer began to pass it in the adjacent left lane. Before the adjacent Class 8 semi-truck and trailer had fully passed the Waymo AV, it executed a right lane change and its trailer (the right side, rear section) entered the lane in which the Waymo AV was traveling and made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV cab. The Waymo AV transitioned to manual mode and the test driver took control. The Waymo AV exited the roadway to the right shoulder of the road and came to a stop off of the roadway. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver's seating position). The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage and the third-party Class 8 semi-truck and trailer did not stop to exchange information. The Waymo AV test driver was transported for medical care and the Waymo AV software operator, seated in the passenger seat, later sought medical attention.
