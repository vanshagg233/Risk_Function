As the vehicle proceeded through its turn, it encountered exhaust fumes from vehicles waiting at a stoplight in the adjacent lane. Due to environmental conditions and sensor limitations, the vehicle's lidar system interpreted the exhaust plume as a solid object in its path. In response, the autonomous vehicle first tried to adjust its position. When this maneuver proved insufficient, the system initiated a hard stop response. The vehicle behind, which was following at approximately 7-8 meters, was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the autonomous vehicle. The collision occurred at relatively low speeds (the autonomous vehicle had decelerated from approximately 7.6 m/s to 0 m/s), though exact impact speeds of the following vehicle were not recorded. The primary factor that led to this incident is that Lidar does not pierce through exhaust so the exhaust cloud appears to be a large, solid object. Some corrective actions that will be implemented: consider weather implication in future platform sensor selection and continue working on the software to improve a neural network to classify lidar points, which will use temporal information, radar, and camera features to make a decision on whether a lidar point is truly an object.",

May's vehicle was traveling at approximately 20 MPH in a residential neighborhood, and was approximately 1m left of lane center when a black vehicle exited a driveway on the right from behind a fence, facing the road and May's vehicle. This vehicle did not slow down or stop until entering into the roadway and collided with the May vehicle's right side. AVO attempts to swerve to the left but is unable to avoid a collision. 
The primary factor that led to the collision was the other vehicles action proceeding without the right-of-way into the side of the May vehicle. Upon further inspection, it was determined that we did not predict this collision until it was too late to avoid it even by veering. The velocity of the other vehicle was underestimated and was largely given only yield policies as having the most significant likelihood. There is some room for improvement in our response, which we plan to implement in future software releases, namely, an emergency veer policy must exist that is capable of moving quickly and far enough to possibly avoid the collision, more accurate reporting of velocity for slow-moving agents, estimate acceleration when assessing risk, improvements to predictions of the probability of an agent yielding, and adjusting our risk assessment so that it is heading dependent and more risk would be associated with passing close in front of another vehicle.",

Instead of turning onto [XXX] immediately, the passenger car creeped forward very slowly indicating that it intended to yield to the Waymo AV and make way for a cyclist passing by on the sidewalk. The Waymo AV predicted that the passenger car would yield in this situation and proceeded past the passenger car. When the Waymo AV was positioned directly in front of the passenger car, the passenger car accelerated out of the shopping center exit and drove into the rear passenger side of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.

As the vehicle navigated this transition of curvature, the May vehicle made contact with the curb, causing a flat tire. 
At the time of the incident, no other vehicles or pedestrians were present in the immediate vicinity, and there were no external factors such as obstructions or adverse weather conditions influencing the vehicles path.
Speed was reduced from 30mph to 25mph after this event and tested (and worked to mitigate the problem in that area) and now will be reduced to 22 which is the sweet spot for most areas on the route.

A vehicle behind the AV was traveling approximately the same speed as the May shuttle. The May AV began to slow for an object ahead. Due to weather conditions, the AV misclassified a speed limit sign as a pedestrian, which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the AV. This caused the May AV to apply additional braking to avoid the projected collision with the misclassified object. The following vehicle did not react promptly when the May AV started to slow down, resulting in the following vehicle braking too late to avoid collision and impacting the May AV from behind.  The following vehicle then pulled around the May vehicle and drove away.  Resimulation of this event with an upcoming software version shows that the May AV would not misidentify the non-exist object so would not have decelerated unnecessarily. This improved software is set to be deployed to the full commercial fleet soon. In addition, per May policy, the commercial fleet would not operate in weather conditions like those present in this incident.",

The physical input from the operator was enough to deviate the vehicle from its intended path but not enough to trigger an intervention and take the vehicle out of autonomy. The vehicle, going straight as the road curved, then struck the curb, resulting in minor vehicle damage. Due to the vehicle being off path, the vehicle begins to stop. This occurs as the operator wakes up. The operator was not injured and no third parties were impacted or otherwise affected by the incident. 
The local May Mobility site staff did not notice any signs of fatigue from this operator prior to going out in the vehicle.

The BCC later informed LYNX dispatch at 12:49PM that the second shuttle operating on route, P131, would also be returning to storage after the operator completed its current loop. At Approximately 12:52 PM, P131 approached the [XXX] stop within the designated Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) operating lane. The shuttle remained stopped for approximately two (2) and a half minutes while three (3) passengers alighted, and two (2) additional passengers boarded the shuttle. During that period, approximately two (2) minutes after stopping to service passengers, a LYNX bus pulled behind P131. Approximately thirty (30) seconds later, the LYNX bus exited the BRT lane and proceeded into the public travel lane alongside the BRT lane. As the LYNX bus entered the public travel lane, the safety driver onboard P131 engaged the autonomous drive system, and the shuttle proceeded in the BRT lane. After both vehicles had begun moving, P131 in the BRT lane and the LYNX bus in the public travel lane, the LYNX bus reentered the BRT lane encroaching on the shuttles path. The bus failed to provide adequate clearance and contacted the left front side of P131. Both vehicles stopped in the BRT lane after the collision. 
Within five (5) minutes of the collision, all passengers had safely alighted from the shuttle with no reported injuries and left the scene without giving statements. At approximately 2:20PM, the City of Orlando Police Department (OPD) arrived on scene to investigate the incident. Beep and LYNX supervisors were on scene to support the investigation. OPD collected statements from both the Beep safety driver and LYNX bus driver. The LYNX supervisor provided OPD access to the LYNX bus camera footage on scene, at which point the investigating officer made a verbal indication that the LYNX bus driver appeared to be at fault for the collision. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug and alcohol screening. 
1.The safety driver did not exhibit complete situational awareness and per their after-incident interview, failed to notice the bus prior to departing the station. Had the attendant continued to look and check behind/alongside P131 prior to departing the station,
the collision may have been avoided.
2.The safety driver attempted to stop the shuttle by disengaging the ADS using the HMI rather than using the emergency stop button. Use of the emergency stop would have increased the deceleration rate to 5 m/s2, decreasing the stopping distance of the shuttle. However, it is not clear whether use of the emergency stop would have fully avoided the collision given the point at which the LYNX LYMMO bus entered the BRT lane.
3.Deficiencies in the standard operating procedures (SOP) between LYNX and Beep allowed for a bus to be deployed onto the service at the same time as P131. Beep communicated to LYNX that both shuttles were exiting the service area. However, LYNX did not wait for final confirmation that both vehicles had left the route prior to dispatching the LYMMO bus involved in the incident, nor did LYNX notify Beep that a bus had been dispatched.

As our safety officer parked and got out of the car to check on the bicyclist, the bicyclist was already on in motion on his bicycle and ""fist bumped"" our safety officer while passing by him and leaving the scene without exchanging any information.",

The following vehicle was traveling approximately twice as fast as the May shuttle and catching up to the May shuttle from behind. The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s.

At 11:01 am, while running the normal route, the Olli contacted the adjacent curb on the front right side, causing tie rod and cosmetic damage. No one was injured and the only damage was to the vehicle itself. The customer contacted RRAI through the client support portal shortly after the incident. No injuries occurred, there were no passengers besides the safety operator, no other vehicles were involved, and no emergency systems were engaged.
Olli 2.0 (S/N 2-18) is an 8-passenger shuttle that is no longer manufactured. The vehicle manufacturer, Local Motors, dissolved in 2022. Local Motors contracted RRAI to install autonomy kits for several Olli shuttles during the period of 2018 - 2020. RRAI provided some support for initial site deployment and ensured customer safety operators were trained on the autonomy system. Since the Local Motors dissolution in 2022, almost all Olli vehicles have been decommissioned.
To date, we have concluded the following:
1. There were no updates or alterations made by RRAI in the months prior to Jan [XXX]. In previous operations, including the immediately preceding operations on January 20th, 2023, Olli 2-18 ran the route as normal with no anomalies. There were no software updates or other system changes before it was run again on January [XXX], 2023, the date of curb contact.
2. The root cause of the curb contact was a communication error with the HD Map registration module. HD Map registration utilizes real-time lidar and positioning data and compares that to a-priori HD maps stored within the autonomy system. A communication problem occurred between the computer running the map registration software and the computer running the navigation algorithms. The cause for the communication problem has been identified and a fix has been implemented to prevent the issue from happening again (see below).
3. Steering was out of calibration. It was noted through data collection that the steering was out of calibration at time of incident. The autonomy system was attempting to correct this issue, but the vehicular steering system could not achieve the required turn radius. This is a vehicular maintenance concern managed by the customer.
It was determined that the HD map registration issue had not been observed during autonomous operations in the previous four years. The solution to prevent further occurrences includes:
1. Implementing a self-diagnostic routine upon system boot, which ensures the communication connection is established. If the connection is not established, this diagnostic will prevent the vehicle from driving autonomously. 
2. Updating the error checks to ensure that during run time, the vehicle will come to a controlled stop in event of a communication problem.  
3. Working with the customer to recalibrate the steering, and assisting in reviewing customer's vehicle maintenance checks for steering calibration if necessary.
4. Continuing to review data to determine other concerns or improvements.",

While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

The May vehicle passed too close to a parked vehicle, causing the May vehicle's passenger-side mirror to contact the parked vehicle's driver-side mirror.
The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. 
UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX]. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.
UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.
TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS FOR THIS ""OTHER"" UPDATED REPORT (12/15/2021): Pony.ai provides the following corrections to its prior reports on the incident: (1) The Pony.ai AV did not turn onto [XXX] from [XXX] as first reported. Rather the Pony.ai AV was traveling straight on [XXX] and crossed through an intersection with [XXX] before entering the segment of [XXX] on which it changed lanes and subsequently had a collision; (2) Pony.ai has updated the VIN number of the subject vehicle in the data fields above, as there was one digit that was incorrect in our original reports due to a clerical error.",

- The content of this report, including the summary of incident below, is the information as Toyota received from May Mobility on Aug [XXX], 2021.
Summary of incident (as Toyota received from May Mobility):
Leading up to the event, the autonomy system functioned as expected, following the route through the intersection, slowing appropriately for other road users and the red light. Vehicle autonomous behavior was performing as expected and did not require a takeover.
Description of event:
16:17:30 May vehicle, traveling East on [XXX], in full working order with no errors, autonomously navigates the [XXX] and [XXX] intersection.
16:17:35 May vehicle autonomously begins to slow to match the speed of a vehicle several car lengths ahead merging into our lane from the right.
16:17:37 By means of an accelerator pedal push the vehicle is moved into manual mode by the safety operator - from this point forward, the vehicle remains under control of the safety operator.
16:17:43 Manual acceleration command via the pedal increases.
16:17:44 Safety operator manually continues straight which, due to the slight change in angle of the road, brings the May vehicle into contact with the first vehicle to the right.
16:17:44 Safety operator manually applies brake.
16:17:45 With the manual brake command now at maximum the May vehicle makes contact with the second vehicle.
Vehicle indicators for manual or autonomy mode:
The visual indicator for autonomy was functioning properly and as expected in the time leading up to and during the event.
The audio communication device in the vehicle was functioning properly and was used to call for assistance and to report the incident.
The audio beep to indicate a state change was functioning properly.
The safety operator had some audio indication that he had exited autonomy and entered manual operation, and he had full visual indication on his dashboard.",
