The vehicle exited the sub-lot and rolled over a curb. The vehicle stopped at a stop sign at the exit of the main lot. As it proceeded to turn onto the main road, it rolled over another curb. Almost immediately after rolling the curb, the vehicle began to drift right in lane, rubbing the vehicle sidewall on a curb. The test driver intervened immediately, but not before the sidewall of the rear right tire was weakened. Later during the drive while under manual control, the sidewall fails, eventually leading to a low pressure indicator illuminating in the dash. It was discovered that the deployment of map files, which must remain compatible, was incomplete, leaving a mismatch in the system. This resulted in the vehicle having an incorrect estimate of where lanes are in the coordinates of our localization map, and as a result, the vehicle had an incorrect estimate of proximity to lane boundaries, resulting in curb strikes.",

This submission is based on the information provided to the Reporter by VW. The Reporter currently believes that it has no independent knowledge of the information in this report.
From Volkswagen:
The subject vehicle (autonomous vehicle - AV) was proceeding through a parking garage while engaged in autonomous driving (AD) mode.  The AV detected an oncoming passenger vehicle (PV), made adjustments to its route by moving to the right, and slowed to a stop to provide additional space for the PV.  As the PV passed, it attempted to make a left-hand turn behind the AV, but the PV's driver side mirror scraped the rear driver's side LiDAR housing of the AV.  The passenger vehicle continued driving without stopping. After noticing the contact, the safety driver of the subject vehicle manually disengaged AD mode to assess the incident.  There were no reported injuries, airbag deployments, or tow-aways.  The damage to the subject vehicle was a scuff to the driver's side Short Range LiDAR trim cover.  VWGoA does not plan to investigate the incident any further as the facts and circumstances do not indicate any issue with the vehicle's performance.",

On July [xxx], 2024, at 12:59 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in [XXX], California was involved in an alleged collision with a non-motorist (cyclist) at a parking garage exit on [XXX] between [XXX] and [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was exiting a parking garage onto [XXX], between [XXX] and [XXX]. As the Waymo AV approached the garage exit, it stopped for a cyclist who was approaching from the left. The Waymo AV remained stationary as the cyclist passed in front of the vehicle, slowed, and appeared to begin to dismount. The cyclist then reached out a hand and made contact with the front passenger side of the stationary Waymo AV, backed the bicycle up slightly, dropped the bicycle, then fell to the ground. 
At the time of the possible impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present. The cyclist received medical attention at the scene and was reportedly transported to a hospital by local emergency services. The Waymo AV did not sustain any damage. 
Even though this event may involve intentional contact by the bicyclist with a stationary Waymo AV and the occurrence of actual impact between the Waymo AV and the cycle is not clear, Waymo is reporting this event as a crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because a media report included an allegation of a crash and because a vulnerable road user (cyclist) influenced the driving task of a vehicle involved and reportedly was transported to a hospital for medical treatment as a result of the event.
