On October [XXX], 2024 at 3:58 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling south in the left lane on [XXX] and came to a stop in a queue of traffic for the red traffic light at the intersection with [XXX]. As the Waymo AV approached the intersection and came to a stop, a passenger car which was following behind the Waymo AV at a low rate of speed approached the Waymo AV from behind and partially crossed into the right-hand travel lane. The passenger car continued proceeding slowly forward until the front of the passenger car made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. After contact occurred, the passenger car remained in contact with the rear of the Waymo AV, and several bystanders approached the passenger car, attempting to communicate with the driver. Once the traffic light turned green, the Waymo AV proceeded through the intersection and pulled over at the curb on the south side of the intersection to avoid obstructing other traffic. While the Waymo AV proceeded through the intersection, the passenger car continued to roll forward into the intersection, and was stopped by several bystanders. Law enforcement communicated to Waymo that the driver of the passenger car was experiencing a medical emergency and was transported from the scene in an ambulance. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.

On February [XXX], 2024 at 2:34 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a bicyclist on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The cyclist had entered the 4-way stop intersection without stopping or yielding. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and the bicyclist reported minor injuries and damage to their bicycle. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear, resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and to our knowledge, the bicyclist reported only minor injuries. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear resumed driving for a short period of time.

There are no other changes to Cruise's previous submission (30412-6395-3): A Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on southbound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.",Y

A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS.

At approximately 5:54 p.m. on Wednesday, August [XXX], 2023, P84, travelling eastbound on [XXX], approached the three-way stop at [XXX] and [XXX]. P84 arrived at the intersection at the same time as two other vehicles: a grey van heading northbound on [XXX] and a red sedan heading westbound on [XXX]. The safety driver yielded to the northbound vehicle, which proceeded to make a right-hand turn eastbound onto [XXX]. After allowing the intersection to clear, the safety driver onboard P84 confirmed that it was safe for the shuttle to proceed through the intersection. As the shuttle entered the intersection, a second vehicle travelling northbound on [XXX], a white sedan, entered the intersection intending a left-hand turn onto westbound [XXX]. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, subsequently colliding at a low rate of speed in the middle of the intersection.  
At approximately 5:57 p.m., the Beep Command Center (BCC) was informed by the safety driver that P84 was involved in a minor collision with another vehicle at the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX]. The incident response protocol was initiated, and a supervisor dispatched to the scene. Local law enforcement (San Francisco Police Department) was contacted to report the collision but declined to respond given the minor nature of the collision, directing both parties to exchange information. After the Beep supervisor arrived on scene at approximately 6:49 p.m., the safety driver and supervisor removed the shuttle from the roadway and exchanged insurance information with the driver of the other vehicle. 
Damage to both vehicles was noted to be very minor. The shuttle sustained light scuffs, chips, and small paint transfer. The other vehicle sustained a small dent on the fender. Neither vehicle required towing, and both were safely driven from the scene. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug & alcohol screening which has since cleared.  
Contributing Factors 
Based on an analysis of the available evidence, Beep has determined the following factors may have contributed to the higher likelihood of a collision occurring in this instance: 
1.The white sedan failed to yield to P84 in accordance with California state law governing intersection priority.
2.The slight bend in P84s path to accommodate the lane shift through the intersection may have reduced the available stopping distance as the white sedan was not perceived as an obstacle in P84s path until it proceeded further into the intersection.
Incident Findings 
Beep developed the following findings regarding this incident:
1.P84 behaved as expected, detecting and maintaining awareness of the white sedan in the moments preceding the collision, commanding hard braking maneuver, and achieving a 3m/s2 deceleration rate once the white sedan encroached on P84s path.
2.The safety driver observed California state law and had the right of way when releasing P84 into the intersection.
3.The safety driver could have avoided the collision by using the emergency stop. The safety driver indicated that they were aware of the other vehicle through the duration of the incident and were aware of the proper procedure in this scenario but panicked in the moment.
Mitigation:
Implement a priority zone to account for the slight bend in the shuttles path and for future vehicles that may fail to yield.",

As the Zoox vehicle came to a stop again for traffic ahead the e-scooter rider did not stop, and the e-scooter made contact with the right rear tail light of the Zoox vehicle. The e-scooter rider remained upright, did not stop to exchange information, and immediately rode off while the Zoox vehicle was still stopped. There were no injuries and police were not called.

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.
Although we do not believe this event falls under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01, we consulted NHTSA and submitted this report at the agencys request on the day of the consultation.

Subject vehicle approached a red light to make a right turn East-bound onto [XXX].  The safety operator suggested that the safety driver disengage the ADS and make the turn in manual mode because the vehicle was hesitant in approaching the intersection. The safety driver disengaged the ADS, and, approximately 250ms later, subject vehicle was lightly struck from behind by a white Mazda3.  Having seen debris on the roadway, the driver and operator believed they had run over a rock and did not realize they were hit by the vehicle. After concluding the mission, the driver and operator found damage to a sensor during an inspection.  A subsequent review of video led to discovery of the crash.  No injuries were reported, and law enforcement was not called to the scene.

The Beep shuttle attendant was traveling Southbound on [XXX] at approx 7-12 mph in ADS and headed towards the intersection of [XXX]. Beep vehicle stopped at red light at intersection. As the Beep vehicle was crossing the intersection in manual and slowing to a stop to return to ADS in a southbound direction, the trailing bus made light contact with its bicycle rack to the Beep shuttle rear end. The trailing vehicle is a bus owned and operated by the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA). According to video, as reported by the shuttle attendant and the PSTA Road Supervisor, the bus was tailgating.
