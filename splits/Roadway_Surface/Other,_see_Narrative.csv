The other tractor-trailer was overtaking Kodiaks truck in the left lane and three-quarters of their truck was past when it veered out of the left lane into the lane occupied by Kodiak and made light contact with the Kodiak trucks drivers side mirror/SensorPod.  The area where this occurred was a construction zone with concrete barrier eliminating the right road shoulder preventing the Kodiak truck driver from being able to make a defensive maneuver to avoid the contact. The driver of the other tractor-trailer continued down the road without stopping.
No material property damage occurred, just surface abrasion to the drivers side SensorPod. There were no injuries reported, and no vehicles were towed from the scene.",
