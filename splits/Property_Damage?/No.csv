The AV was eastbound on [XXX], approaching the intersection with [XXX], in the furthest left of five lanes (lane one), a dedicated left turn lane.  Another vehicle, originally traveling in a middle through-traffic lane (lane three), had entered lane two, also a dedicated left turn lane, and come to a stop almost perpendicular to the flow of traffic.  As the AV approached the other vehicle began moving from lane two into lane one without signaling.

As always, there were two safety drivers in the car. Traffic was moving in all four lanes at or near the speed limit. The Ghost vehicle was in the right-middle lane. Another vehicle (the ""lead"" car) entered into the Ghost car's lane from the right. While there were numerous vehicles ahead of the Ghost car before that vehicle entered the lane, the lead vehicle blocked the view of the lane before it. Throughout the incident, traffic in the other three lanes continued at a steady pace.
When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds. The Ghost car was able to match the rapid speed reduction of the lead car and avoid contact.
The driver following the Ghost car was not able to respond as quickly as the Ghost ADS. When the following driver began to apply the brakes, the car was about five meters behind and was traveling at 6.5 mps. At the point of impact, the Ghost vehicle was traveling at 4.78 mps (10.7 mph), matching the lead car. There were no injuries. The vehicles suffered only cosmetic damage, the drivers exchanged information, and the Ghost safety drivers returned to home base in conventional mode.",

A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.",Y

The physical input from the operator was enough to deviate the vehicle from its intended path but not enough to trigger an intervention and take the vehicle out of autonomy. The vehicle, going straight as the road curved, then struck the curb, resulting in minor vehicle damage. Due to the vehicle being off path, the vehicle begins to stop. This occurs as the operator wakes up. The operator was not injured and no third parties were impacted or otherwise affected by the incident. 
The local May Mobility site staff did not notice any signs of fatigue from this operator prior to going out in the vehicle. The operator had responded to audio check-ins from site staff at a regular interval. We are exploring additional risk mitigation options for in-cabin health monitoring, in addition to the existing cameras and radio check-ins.",

The BCC later informed LYNX dispatch at 12:49PM that the second shuttle operating on route, P131, would also be returning to storage after the operator completed its current loop. At Approximately 12:52 PM, P131 approached the [XXX] stop within the designated Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) operating lane. The shuttle remained stopped for approximately two (2) and a half minutes while three (3) passengers alighted, and two (2) additional passengers boarded the shuttle. During that period, approximately two (2) minutes after stopping to service passengers, a LYNX bus pulled behind P131. Approximately thirty (30) seconds later, the LYNX bus exited the BRT lane and proceeded into the public travel lane alongside the BRT lane. As the LYNX bus entered the public travel lane, the safety driver onboard P131 engaged the autonomous drive system, and the shuttle proceeded in the BRT lane. After both vehicles had begun moving, P131 in the BRT lane and the LYNX bus in the public travel lane, the LYNX bus reentered the BRT lane encroaching on the shuttles path. The bus failed to provide adequate clearance and contacted the left front side of P131. Both vehicles stopped in the BRT lane after the collision. 
Within five (5) minutes of the collision, all passengers had safely alighted from the shuttle with no reported injuries and left the scene without giving statements. At approximately 2:20PM, the City of Orlando Police Department (OPD) arrived on scene to investigate the incident. Beep and LYNX supervisors were on scene to support the investigation. OPD collected statements from both the Beep safety driver and LYNX bus driver. The LYNX supervisor provided OPD access to the LYNX bus camera footage on scene, at which point the investigating officer made a verbal indication that the LYNX bus driver appeared to be at fault for the collision. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug and alcohol screening. 
1.The safety driver did not exhibit complete situational awareness and per their after-incident interview, failed to notice the bus prior to departing the station. Had the attendant continued to look and check behind/alongside P131 prior to departing the station,
the collision may have been avoided.
2.The safety driver attempted to stop the shuttle by disengaging the ADS using the HMI rather than using the emergency stop button. Use of the emergency stop would have increased the deceleration rate to 5 m/s2, decreasing the stopping distance of the shuttle. However, it is not clear whether use of the emergency stop would have fully avoided the collision given the point at which the LYNX LYMMO bus entered the BRT lane.
3.Deficiencies in the standard operating procedures (SOP) between LYNX and Beep allowed for a bus to be deployed onto the service at the same time as P131. Beep communicated to LYNX that both shuttles were exiting the service area. However, LYNX did not wait for final confirmation that both vehicles had left the route prior to dispatching the LYMMO bus involved in the incident, nor did LYNX notify Beep that a bus had been dispatched.

At approximately 5:54 p.m. on Wednesday, August [XXX], 2023, P84, travelling eastbound on [XXX], approached the three-way stop at [XXX] and [XXX]. P84 arrived at the intersection at the same time as two other vehicles: a grey van heading northbound on [XXX] and a red sedan heading westbound on [XXX]. The safety driver yielded to the northbound vehicle, which proceeded to make a right-hand turn eastbound onto [XXX]. After allowing the intersection to clear, the safety driver onboard P84 confirmed that it was safe for the shuttle to proceed through the intersection. As the shuttle entered the intersection, a second vehicle travelling northbound on [XXX], a white sedan, entered the intersection intending a left-hand turn onto westbound [XXX]. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, subsequently colliding at a low rate of speed in the middle of the intersection.  
At approximately 5:57 p.m., the Beep Command Center (BCC) was informed by the safety driver that P84 was involved in a minor collision with another vehicle at the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX]. The incident response protocol was initiated, and a supervisor dispatched to the scene. Local law enforcement (San Francisco Police Department) was contacted to report the collision but declined to respond given the minor nature of the collision, directing both parties to exchange information. After the Beep supervisor arrived on scene at approximately 6:49 p.m., the safety driver and supervisor removed the shuttle from the roadway and exchanged insurance information with the driver of the other vehicle. 
Damage to both vehicles was noted to be very minor. The shuttle sustained light scuffs, chips, and small paint transfer. The other vehicle sustained a small dent on the fender. Neither vehicle required towing, and both were safely driven from the scene. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug & alcohol screening which has since cleared.  
Contributing Factors 
Based on an analysis of the available evidence, Beep has determined the following factors may have contributed to the higher likelihood of a collision occurring in this instance: 
1.The white sedan failed to yield to P84 in accordance with California state law governing intersection priority.
2.The slight bend in P84s path to accommodate the lane shift through the intersection may have reduced the available stopping distance as the white sedan was not perceived as an obstacle in P84s path until it proceeded further into the intersection.
Incident Findings 
Beep developed the following findings regarding this incident:
1.P84 behaved as expected, detecting and maintaining awareness of the white sedan in the moments preceding the collision, commanding hard braking maneuver, and achieving a 3m/s2 deceleration rate once the white sedan encroached on P84s path.
2.The safety driver observed California state law and had the right of way when releasing P84 into the intersection.
3.The safety driver could have avoided the collision by using the emergency stop. The safety driver indicated that they were aware of the other vehicle through the duration of the incident and were aware of the proper procedure in this scenario but panicked in the moment.
Mitigation:
Implement a priority zone to account for the slight bend in the shuttles path and for future vehicles that may fail to yield.",

The following vehicle was traveling approximately twice as fast as the May shuttle and catching up to the May shuttle from behind. The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s. Re-simulation of this event with a future software version shows that the May shuttle would have decelerated less abruptly.",
