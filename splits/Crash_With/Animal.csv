The vehicle's automated driving system (""ADS"") was engaged within 30 seconds prior to the event. Although a deer strike does not appear to meet the SGO's definition of a crash (i.e., impact with a vehicle, other road user, or property), we are reporting this incident out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of transparency. 
At the time of the incident, the vehicle was traveling westbound in the rightmost lane of [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]. A deer crossed the eastbound lanes of traffic and median before entering the westbound lanes.  Torc's in-vehicle fallback test driver (""IFTD""), positioned in the driver's seat, noticed the deer as it entered the westbound lanes. The IFTD took control of the vehicle by disengaging the ADS. The deer then contacted the left side of the tractor. After the physical impact with the tractor, the deer deflected into the left lane toward the left shoulder of the roadway and did not contact other road users. The IFTD reduced the speed of the vehicle and navigated to a rest area to inspect it. During the inspection, the IFTD observed minor damage on the driver's side of the tractor but deemed the vehicle roadworthy for manual operation.  The IFTD contacted local law enforcement to notify them of the event. The test crew (IFTD, safety conductor, and passenger) returned the vehicle to the Torc test operations site.",Y

The vehicle's automated driving system (""ADS"") was engaged within 30 seconds prior to the event. Although a deer strike does not appear to meet the SGO's definition of a crash (i.e., impact with a vehicle, other road user, or property), we are reporting this incident out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of transparency. 
At the time of the incident, the vehicle was traveling westbound in the rightmost lane of [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]. A deer crossed the eastbound lanes of traffic and median before entering the westbound lanes.  Torc's in-vehicle fallback test driver (""IFTD""), positioned in the driver's seat, noticed the deer as it entered the westbound lanes. The IFTD took control of the vehicle by disengaging the ADS. The deer then contacted the left side of the tractor. After the physical impact with the tractor, the deer deflected into the left lane toward the left shoulder of the roadway and did not contact other road users. The IFTD reduced the speed of the vehicle and navigated to a rest area to inspect it. During the inspection, the IFTD observed minor damage on the driver's side of the tractor but deemed the vehicle roadworthy for manual operation.  The IFTD contacted local law enforcement to notify them of the event. The test crew (IFTD, safety conductor, and passenger) returned the vehicle to the Torc test operations site.",Y
