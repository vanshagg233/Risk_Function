Plus's safety drivers are experienced and well-trained. The Safety Driver operating the particular vehicle has 12-years of over-the-road commercial vehicle driving experience. All safety drivers are trained to manage potential hazards they may encounter on the roads and are encouraged to retake control of the vehicle whenever necessary to ensure safe operation.  
Here, the Plus vehicle was traveling Northbound on [XXX] at approximately 63 mph in mild to moderate traffic with clear weather conditions.  According to the video camera log, the truck was in autonomous mode when a black SUV traveling in the right-most driving lane swerved to the right into the emergency lane (i.e., the shoulder) to avoid a vehicle that had stopped before it in the driving lane. Seeing the disabled vehicle in the driving lane, the Plus Safety Driver took control of the truck by applying the brakes and began to decelerate the vehicle. Two vehicles traveling behind the black SUV in the same lane then swerved to the left and into the lane in which the Plus vehicle was traveling.  The left side of the second of these vehicles (a minivan) made contact with the Plus truck's right side. [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
The Plus truck swerved slightly into the lane to its left as a result of the contact, avoiding a pickup truck that was passing by it. The Safety Driver then re-centered the vehicle into the truck's original lane. After the contact, the minivan moved into the rightmost lane and then ultimately came to a stop in the emergency lane.  The Plus Safety Driver changed lanes and also brought the truck to a stop in the emergency lane.
A Police report was taken at the scene, but the Plus Safety Driver did not receive a copy of it.  Based on our best information, none of the passengers in the minivan reported injuries and the only damage was to the vehicle's driver-side tire.  The minivan nevertheless was towed away from the scene.  The Plus truck did not have any damage and was able to continue driving to its destination.",Y

As the Waymo AV began to slow to initiate a pull over (still pushing the barrier), the rightmost edge of the barrier made contact with the driver side of two other postal vans and two passenger cars that were also parked at the curb of southwestbound [XXX]. The Waymo AV continued to push the barrier as it completed the pullover, coming to a stop on the right side of  southwestbound [XXX]. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The metal barrier and all vehicles mentioned sustained damage.

On August [XXX], 2023 at 6:11 PM PT, a Waymo AV operating in San Francisco, California was stopped at a red light in the dedicated left turn lane on the left side of northeast-bound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. While the light was red, a fire engine approached the Waymo AV from behind and the Waymo AV moved forward as far as possible before entering the intersection at [XXX]. After the light turned green and as the Waymo AV was calculating a path into the intersection to clear the way, the fire engine maneuvered around the Waymo AV on the right side. During this maneuver, the right side of the fire engine appears to have made contact with the front left corner of an SUV that was stopped in the through lane to the right of the Waymo AV. The fire engine then proceeded through the intersection, and shortly afterwards, another fire engine and a fire department SUV passed on the left side the Waymo AV of the stopped Waymo AV. The Waymo AV then proceeded through the intersection.

Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control of the car by manually braking and disengaging the autonomous system.  The car was traveling 55.3 mph when the driver began to brake.  The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car.  A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car.  Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over.  To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured.
