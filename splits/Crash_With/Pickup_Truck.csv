NHTSA-Provided Report # 30530-6818-1
This incident occurred near Ranger, TX on [XXX]  approximately 9:56 am CT on November [XXX], 2023. The Aurora vehicle was operating in autonomy at the time. Conditions were overcast, with light rain. As the Aurora vehicle was driving in its lane at 67 mph, a Ford pick-up truck overtaking the Aurora vehicle in the rightmost lane at approximately 80 mph appears to have hydroplaned, lost control, and hit the passenger-side rear portion of the trailer. 
Before the collision, the Aurora Driver detected the pick-up truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge to the left to provide space. This was insufficient to completely avoid the collision, and the pickup truck made contact with the passenger side rear of the trailer. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Vehicle Operator received the notification that a collision had been detected and was initiating an incident response. The Vehicle Operator did not visually observe the collision and therefore assumed the reaction of the Aurora Driver to be a software anomaly worth escalated attention, rather than the correct detection of a collision and thus reported the incident through our escalated annotation protocol, rather than through our incident response protocols. We identified the incident at approximately 8:45 am CT on December [XXX], 2023 through a review of our data logs.
At this time, we are not aware of any injuries and, from camera footage, the pick-up truck also appears to have left the scene of the incident. There is also no indication of any cargo or major trailer damage.",

The Waymo AV was stopped at a red light in the middle lane, facing northbound on [XXX] at [XXX]. When the light turned green, the pickup truck in the left turn lane to the left of the Waymo AV did not immediately proceed, and the Waymo AV attempted to merge into the left lane and make a left turn onto westbound [XXX] to pick up a rider that had hailed the Waymo AV while the vehicle was waiting at the red light.

The Kodiak AV had been braking for over 11 seconds in lane to safely accommodate two pedestrians and their vehicles near the fog line on the shoulder when a pickup truck rear-ended the Kodiak AV. 
The Kodiak AV was operating with a safety driver (in the drivers seating position), who transitioned the vehicle from autonomous to manual mode immediately prior to impact. At the time of impact, the Kodiak AV was in manual mode.
No injuries occurred in the incident. The Kodiak AV's rear lightbar sustained minor damage, as did the pickup trucks front bumper and hood.  Both vehicles were able to drive away from the scene.

The May vehicle passed too close to a parked vehicle, causing the May vehicle's passenger-side mirror to contact the parked vehicle's driver-side mirror.
The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV began to enter the right lane of a protected double left turn lane ('Lane 2') from northbound [XXX] to westbound [XXX]. A pickup truck heading southbound on [XXX] had completely crossed the double-yellow lines of the northbound double left turn lanes and positioned itself in the left lane of the double turn lane ('Lane 1') facing the wrong direction against traffic and was preparing to make a left turn across Lane 2 and the other two northbound lanes into a shopping center parking lot on the east side of [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in Lane 2 when the pickup truck began to initiate its left turn from Lane 1. The Waymo AV braked, and the trained human driver in the Waymo AV (in the driver's seating position), transitioned the vehicle from autonomous to manual mode. As the pickup truck made the left turn, the driver's side panels of the pickup truck made contact with the driver's side rear corner of the Waymo AV causing moderate damage to the Waymo AV. Damage to the pickup is currently unknown. At the time of contact, the Waymo AV was in manual mode.
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because the Waymo AV was towed from the scene. Waymo may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available. This report was submitted from the Pacific time zone on the required date.",
