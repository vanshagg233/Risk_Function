The vehicle exited the sub-lot and rolled over a curb. The vehicle stopped at a stop sign at the exit of the main lot. As it proceeded to turn onto the main road, it rolled over another curb. Almost immediately after rolling the curb, the vehicle began to drift right in lane, rubbing the vehicle sidewall on a curb. The test driver intervened immediately, but not before the sidewall of the rear right tire was weakened. Later during the drive while under manual control, the sidewall fails, eventually leading to a low pressure indicator illuminating in the dash. It was discovered that the deployment of map files, which must remain compatible, was incomplete, leaving a mismatch in the system. This resulted in the vehicle having an incorrect estimate of where lanes are in the coordinates of our localization map, and as a result, the vehicle had an incorrect estimate of proximity to lane boundaries, resulting in curb strikes.",

The speed limit on the country road is 35MPH. The customer noticed a pothole on the side of the road, swerved towards the middle of the road to avoid it, but the LKA assist engaged and moved the vehicle back in the lane. By doing so, the vehicle ran over the pothole, with both front and back passenger side tires and damaged both wheel and tires in the process. During our investigation, we determined that in this case the LKA worked as intended. The system is designed to prioritize a solid line, and can't detect a pothole, and since the road is very narrow (our estimate is less than 3m per side) the vehicle unfortunately ran over the pothole. LKA/ELK system limitations throughout the industry are similar: the LKA/ELK systems try to keep vehicle inside the lane, to prevent a vehicle from drifting out, and the system can't predict driver intention, for example: Is the driver crossing solid lane intentionally or by accident, is hard to distinguish. Relevant override conditions in this case are:
- Steering wheel speed  200deg/s
- Steering torque  3.5Nm
In our application, the override force is limited by the EU homologation test and therefore, we feel that the vehicle behaved as expected and should have been over-powered by the driver to avoid the pothole, thus eliminating a costly replacement cost of two wheels and tires.",

As the vehicle navigated this transition of curvature, the May vehicle made contact with the curb, causing a flat tire. 
At the time of the incident, no other vehicles or pedestrians were present in the immediate vicinity, and there were no external factors such as obstructions or adverse weather conditions influencing the vehicles path.
Speed was reduced from 30mph to 25mph after this event and tested (and worked to mitigate the problem in that area) and now will be reduced to 22 which is the sweet spot for most areas on the route. The May vehicle chose to maneuver at the curb due to perceived risk from a car in an adjacent lane, so May is increasing the allowed distance to the curb to mitigate how close the vehicles are allowed to get.",

The physical input from the operator was enough to deviate the vehicle from its intended path but not enough to trigger an intervention and take the vehicle out of autonomy. The vehicle, going straight as the road curved, then struck the curb, resulting in minor vehicle damage. Due to the vehicle being off path, the vehicle begins to stop. This occurs as the operator wakes up. The operator was not injured and no third parties were impacted or otherwise affected by the incident. 
The local May Mobility site staff did not notice any signs of fatigue from this operator prior to going out in the vehicle. The operator had responded to audio check-ins from site staff at a regular interval. We are exploring additional risk mitigation options for in-cabin health monitoring, in addition to the existing cameras and radio check-ins.",

At 11:01 am, while running the normal route, the Olli contacted the adjacent curb on the front right side, causing tie rod and cosmetic damage. No one was injured and the only damage was to the vehicle itself. The customer contacted RRAI through the client support portal shortly after the incident. No injuries occurred, there were no passengers besides the safety operator, no other vehicles were involved, and no emergency systems were engaged.
Olli 2.0 (S/N 2-18) is an 8-passenger shuttle that is no longer manufactured. The vehicle manufacturer, Local Motors, dissolved in 2022. Local Motors contracted RRAI to install autonomy kits for several Olli shuttles during the period of 2018 - 2020. RRAI provided some support for initial site deployment and ensured customer safety operators were trained on the autonomy system. Since the Local Motors dissolution in 2022, almost all Olli vehicles have been decommissioned.
To date, we have concluded the following:
1. There were no updates or alterations made by RRAI in the months prior to Jan [XXX]. In previous operations, including the immediately preceding operations on January 20th, 2023, Olli 2-18 ran the route as normal with no anomalies. There were no software updates or other system changes before it was run again on January [XXX], 2023, the date of curb contact.
2. The root cause of the curb contact was a communication error with the HD Map registration module. HD Map registration utilizes real-time lidar and positioning data and compares that to a-priori HD maps stored within the autonomy system. A communication problem occurred between the computer running the map registration software and the computer running the navigation algorithms. The cause for the communication problem has been identified and a fix has been implemented to prevent the issue from happening again (see below).
3. Steering was out of calibration. It was noted through data collection that the steering was out of calibration at time of incident. The autonomy system was attempting to correct this issue, but the vehicular steering system could not achieve the required turn radius. This is a vehicular maintenance concern managed by the customer.
It was determined that the HD map registration issue had not been observed during autonomous operations in the previous four years. The solution to prevent further occurrences includes:
1. Implementing a self-diagnostic routine upon system boot, which ensures the communication connection is established. If the connection is not established, this diagnostic will prevent the vehicle from driving autonomously. 
2. Updating the error checks to ensure that during run time, the vehicle will come to a controlled stop in event of a communication problem.  
3. Working with the customer to recalibrate the steering, and assisting in reviewing customer's vehicle maintenance checks for steering calibration if necessary.
4. Continuing to review data to determine other concerns or improvements.",

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. 
UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX]. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.
UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.
TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS FOR THIS ""OTHER"" UPDATED REPORT (12/15/2021): Pony.ai provides the following corrections to its prior reports on the incident: (1) The Pony.ai AV did not turn onto [XXX] from [XXX] as first reported. Rather the Pony.ai AV was traveling straight on [XXX] and crossed through an intersection with [XXX] before entering the segment of [XXX] on which it changed lanes and subsequently had a collision; (2) Pony.ai has updated the VIN number of the subject vehicle in the data fields above, as there was one digit that was incorrect in our original reports due to a clerical error.",

The vehicle was traveling South-bound on [XXX], an eight-lane divided road, operated by the vehicles Level 4 Automated Driving System and supervised by a safety driver in the drivers designated seating position, and with a safety operator in the front passenger seating position.  Subject vehicle moved to the right of the lane to turn right onto West-bound [XXX], a two-lane road, and made contact with a curb at approximately 13-miles per hour.  The safety driver was monitoring the behavior of a vehicle passing in the left lane for signs that it might enter subject vehicles path and did not see subject vehicle moving toward the curb in time to intervene and avoid contact.  During the incident, the safety driver disengaged the Automated Driving System, and then pulled the vehicle to the side of [XXX] and inspected the vehicle and curb for damage.  After the inspection, the safety driver drove the vehicle back to base with the Automated Driving System disengaged.  Subject vehicle did not sustain tire or wheel damage, but the contact resulted in misalignment.
