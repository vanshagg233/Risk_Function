The motorcyclist clipped the right rear corner of Vehicle 3, deflecting the motorcycle to the right, causing the motorcyclist to lose control and fall to the pavement. The motorcyclist was sliding on the pavement when the motorcycle made contact with the Zoox vehicle's rear bumper. The Zoox vehicle operator disengaged from autonomy and brought the vehicle to a stop. The motorcycle came to rest on its right side with the motorcyclist's right leg stuck underneath the motorcycle. An adjacent bystander immediately aided the motorcyclist and asked the Zoox vehicle operator to move the Zoox vehicle ""slightly forward"". After the Zoox operator moved the vehicle forward, the bystander lifted the motorcycle and the motorcyclist remained on the ground for a short period of time before standing up and walking around the scene.

The motorcyclist clipped the right rear corner of Vehicle 3, deflecting the motorcycle to the right, causing the motorcyclist to lose control and fall to the pavement. The motorcyclist was sliding on the pavement when the motorcycle made contact with the Zoox vehicle's rear bumper. The Zoox vehicle operator disengaged from autonomy and brought the vehicle to a stop. The motorcycle came to rest on its right side with the motorcyclist's right leg stuck underneath the motorcycle. An adjacent bystander immediately aided the motorcyclist and asked the Zoox vehicle operator to move the Zoox vehicle ""slightly forward"".

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.
