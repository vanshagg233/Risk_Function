On February [XXX], 2024 at 2:34 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a bicyclist on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The cyclist had entered the 4-way stop intersection without stopping or yielding. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and the bicyclist reported minor injuries and damage to their bicycle. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear, resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

As the Argo AV was passing the cyclist (while maintaining more than 2 meters of lateral margin), the cyclist veered left into the Argo AV's lane. In response, the Argo AV steered away from the cyclist, but the cyclist continued into the lane and the bicycle's left handlebar made contact with the Argo AV's passenger side door handle. The Test Specialist brought the AV to a stop. The cyclist maintained balance, continued to cross the lanes behind the stopped Argo AV, and left the scene after a brief conversation with the left seat Test Specialist, during which the cyclist indicated that he was fine and apologized.
