Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 sustained moderate damages.
After discussing the incident with vehicle 2's driver, they admitted they were attempting to make an upcoming right turn off the expressway. They initiated 2 consecutive right lane changes abruptly before hitting vehicle 1 on their last attempted lane change.
After the initial impact, vehicle 1 was forced out of the initial lane, onto a divide, and ultimately came to a stop on the shoulder of the expressway. At this time both occupants of vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 were able to assess respective damages and exchange information. It was determined that there were no injuries.

From Volkswagen:
The subject vehicle (autonomous vehicle - AV) was stopped at a red traffic light, in a queue of vehicles, heading west on [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION], with autonomous driving (AD) mode engaged. Once the light turned green, the queue of vehicles started to move forward, the AV started to move forward with the queue, and prior to crossing the intersection, the AV was struck from behind by an SUV. After impact the safety driver of the AV applied the brakes to disengage AD mode and then proceeded to find a safe spot to assess the incident by turning right onto [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]. The driver of the SUV followed the AV to a safe location to assess the incident and exchange contact information. There were no reported injuries, airbag deployments, or tow-aways between either party involved.  The AV sustained minor damage to the rear of the vehicle including the rear bumper cover, rear bumper carrier, and a rear facing camera. The SUV damage was reported as scratches and dents to the front bumper cover. Both vehicles were able to safely drive away from the scene.

On Julu [XXX], 2024 at 5:41 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving an SUV on [XXX] at [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was stopped facing a green traffic light on southeastbound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX] to yield to a traffic control officer who was directing traffic in the crosswalk. While the Waymo AV remained stopped and the traffic light turned yellow, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV approached the Waymo AV and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. When the traffic light ahead of the Waymo AV turned green and the Waymo AV remained stopped, the SUV reversed briefly and then changed lanes into the left adjacent lane to maneuver around the Waymo AV, making contact with the rear driver side corner of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impacts, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage, and the SUV left the scene.

A vehicle behind the AV was traveling approximately the same speed as the May shuttle. The May AV began to slow for an object ahead. Due to weather conditions, the AV misclassified a speed limit sign as a pedestrian, which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the AV. This caused the May AV to apply additional braking to avoid the projected collision with the misclassified object. The following vehicle did not react promptly when the May AV started to slow down, resulting in the following vehicle braking too late to avoid collision and impacting the May AV from behind.  The following vehicle then pulled around the May vehicle and drove away.  Resimulation of this event with an upcoming software version shows that the May AV would not misidentify the non-exist object so would not have decelerated unnecessarily. This improved software is set to be deployed to the full commercial fleet soon. In addition, per May policy, the commercial fleet would not operate in weather conditions like those present in this incident.",
