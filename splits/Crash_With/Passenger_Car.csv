As the vehicle proceeded through its turn, it encountered exhaust fumes from vehicles waiting at a stoplight in the adjacent lane. Due to environmental conditions and sensor limitations, the vehicle's lidar system interpreted the exhaust plume as a solid object in its path. In response, the autonomous vehicle first tried to adjust its position. When this maneuver proved insufficient, the system initiated a hard stop response. The vehicle behind, which was following at approximately 7-8 meters, was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the autonomous vehicle. The collision occurred at relatively low speeds (the autonomous vehicle had decelerated from approximately 7.6 m/s to 0 m/s), though exact impact speeds of the following vehicle were not recorded. The primary factor that led to this incident is that Lidar does not pierce through exhaust so the exhaust cloud appears to be a large, solid object. Some corrective actions that will be implemented: consider weather implication in future platform sensor selection and continue working on the software to improve a neural network to classify lidar points, which will use temporal information, radar, and camera features to make a decision on whether a lidar point is truly an object.",

May's vehicle was traveling at approximately 20 MPH in a residential neighborhood, and was approximately 1m left of lane center when a black vehicle exited a driveway on the right from behind a fence, facing the road and May's vehicle. This vehicle did not slow down or stop until entering into the roadway and collided with the May vehicle's right side. AVO attempts to swerve to the left but is unable to avoid a collision. 
The primary factor that led to the collision was the other vehicles action proceeding without the right-of-way into the side of the May vehicle. Upon further inspection, it was determined that we did not predict this collision until it was too late to avoid it even by veering. The velocity of the other vehicle was underestimated and was largely given only yield policies as having the most significant likelihood. There is some room for improvement in our response, which we plan to implement in future software releases, namely, an emergency veer policy must exist that is capable of moving quickly and far enough to possibly avoid the collision, more accurate reporting of velocity for slow-moving agents, estimate acceleration when assessing risk, improvements to predictions of the probability of an agent yielding, and adjusting our risk assessment so that it is heading dependent and more risk would be associated with passing close in front of another vehicle.",

On September 26, 2024 at 11:27 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling northeastbound on [XXX] when it encountered a stationary garbage truck in the dedicated right turn lane at [XXX].  The AV maneuvered to the left of the garbage truck and into the through lane and continued on [XXX] onto a segment of the road where private vehicle traffic is restricted.  The Waymo AV continued traveling on [XXX], where no turns are permitted, and came to a stop at the intersection at [XXX] because the intersection was excluded from the available area for Waymo AV traversal due to the private vehicle restriction.  While the Waymo AV remained stopped with its hazards on, a passenger car traveling northeast on [XXX] passed by the Waymo AV.  As the passenger car passed by Waymo AV, the passenger side of the passenger car made contact with the rear driver side of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage.

From Volkswagen:
The subject vehicle (autonomous vehicle - AV) was proceeding through a parking garage while engaged in autonomous driving (AD) mode.  The AV detected an oncoming passenger vehicle (PV), made adjustments to its route by moving to the right, and slowed to a stop to provide additional space for the PV.  As the PV passed, it attempted to make a left-hand turn behind the AV, but the PV's driver side mirror scraped the rear driver's side LiDAR housing of the AV.  The passenger vehicle continued driving without stopping. After noticing the contact, the safety driver of the subject vehicle manually disengaged AD mode to assess the incident.  There were no reported injuries, airbag deployments, or tow-aways.  The damage to the subject vehicle was a scuff to the driver's side Short Range LiDAR trim cover.

On October [XXX], 2024 at 9:04 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane of two northbound lanes on [XXX] near the intersection with [XXX] when it encountered the scene of a prior collision between a passenger car and an SUV. The two vehicles were stopped in the rightmost lane. The Waymo AV came to a stop behind the passenger car and a queue of traffic in the left lane began passing the scene. While the Waymo AV was stopped, occupants of the SUV and the passenger car exited their vehicles, apparently to inspect damage and/or exchange information. The Waymo AV detected these pedestrians and began yielding to them while attempting to plan a passing maneuver to clear the scene. Shortly after the pedestrians exited their vehicles, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left followed by a passenger car that had been stopped behind the SUV. As the passenger car initiated its passing maneuver, a heavy truck passing the scene in the left lane made contact with the drive side of the passenger car. The impact between the heavy truck and the passenger car caused the passenger side of the passenger car to make contact with the rear left corner of the stopped Waymo AV.

The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane of two northbound lanes on [XXX] near the intersection with [XXX] when it encountered the scene of a prior collision between a passenger car and an SUV. The two vehicles were stopped in the rightmost lane. The Waymo AV came to a stop behind the passenger car and a queue of traffic in the left lane began passing the scene. While the Waymo AV was stopped, occupants of the SUV and the passenger car exited their vehicles, apparently to inspect damage and/or exchange information. The Waymo AV detected these pedestrians and began yielding to them while attempting to plan a passing maneuver to clear the scene. Shortly after the pedestrians exited their vehicles, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left followed by a passenger car that had been stopped behind the SUV. As the passenger car initiated its passing maneuver, a heavy truck passing the scene in the left lane made contact with the drive side of the passenger car. The impact between the heavy truck and the passenger car caused the passenger side of the passenger car to make contact with the rear left corner of the stopped Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. All three vehicles sustained damage.

On June [XXX], 2024 at 4:55AM MT, a Cruise autonomous vehicle (""AV"") operating in supervised autonomous mode with three Cruise AV test operators onboard was traveling southbound on [XXX] in [XXX], Arizona when it approached a red light at the intersection with [XXX]. As the AV was stopping at the red light, a Chrysler PT Cruiser approached the AV from the rear but failed to stop and struck the rear of the nearly-stopped AV, causing severe damage to the Cruise AV and damage to the Chrysler PT Cruiser. The impact of the collision pushed the AV into the center of the intersection before the pair came to a stop. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called and came to the scene. The three Cruise AV test operators reported minor injuries. No parties were transported to the hospital from the scene of the collision, but the three AVTOs were later examined at a health care facility. The Cruise AV was towed from the scene.",

Another vehicle (the ""lead"" car) entered into the Ghost car's lane from the right. While there were numerous vehicles ahead of the Ghost car before that vehicle entered the lane, the lead vehicle blocked the view of the lane before it. Throughout the incident, traffic in the other three lanes continued at a steady pace.
When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds. The Ghost car was able to match the rapid speed reduction of the lead car and avoid contact.
The driver following the Ghost car was not able to respond as quickly as the Ghost ADS. When the following driver began to apply the brakes, the car was about five meters behind and was traveling at 6.5 mps. At the point of impact, the Ghost vehicle was traveling at 4.78 mps (10.7 mph), matching the lead car. There were no injuries. The vehicles suffered only cosmetic damage, the drivers exchanged information, and the Ghost safety drivers returned to home base in conventional mode.",

At approximately 5:54 p.m. on Wednesday, August [XXX], 2023, P84, travelling eastbound on [XXX], approached the three-way stop at [XXX] and [XXX]. P84 arrived at the intersection at the same time as two other vehicles: a grey van heading northbound on [XXX] and a red sedan heading westbound on [XXX]. The safety driver yielded to the northbound vehicle, which proceeded to make a right-hand turn eastbound onto [XXX]. After allowing the intersection to clear, the safety driver onboard P84 confirmed that it was safe for the shuttle to proceed through the intersection. As the shuttle entered the intersection, a second vehicle travelling northbound on [XXX], a white sedan, entered the intersection intending a left-hand turn onto westbound [XXX]. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, subsequently colliding at a low rate of speed in the middle of the intersection.  
At approximately 5:57 p.m., the Beep Command Center (BCC) was informed by the safety driver that P84 was involved in a minor collision with another vehicle at the intersection of [XXX] and [XXX]. The incident response protocol was initiated, and a supervisor dispatched to the scene. Local law enforcement (San Francisco Police Department) was contacted to report the collision but declined to respond given the minor nature of the collision, directing both parties to exchange information. After the Beep supervisor arrived on scene at approximately 6:49 p.m., the safety driver and supervisor removed the shuttle from the roadway and exchanged insurance information with the driver of the other vehicle. 
Damage to both vehicles was noted to be very minor. The shuttle sustained light scuffs, chips, and small paint transfer. The other vehicle sustained a small dent on the fender. Neither vehicle required towing, and both were safely driven from the scene. 
Beeps safety driver was subsequently subjected to a standard post-collision drug & alcohol screening which has since cleared.  
Contributing Factors 
Based on an analysis of the available evidence, Beep has determined the following factors may have contributed to the higher likelihood of a collision occurring in this instance: 
1.The white sedan failed to yield to P84 in accordance with California state law governing intersection priority.
2.The slight bend in P84s path to accommodate the lane shift through the intersection may have reduced the available stopping distance as the white sedan was not perceived as an obstacle in P84s path until it proceeded further into the intersection.
Incident Findings 
Beep developed the following findings regarding this incident:
1.P84 behaved as expected, detecting and maintaining awareness of the white sedan in the moments preceding the collision, commanding hard braking maneuver, and achieving a 3m/s2 deceleration rate once the white sedan encroached on P84s path.
2.The safety driver observed California state law and had the right of way when releasing P84 into the intersection.
3.The safety driver could have avoided the collision by using the emergency stop. The safety driver indicated that they were aware of the other vehicle through the duration of the incident and were aware of the proper procedure in this scenario but panicked in the moment.
Mitigation:
Implement a priority zone to account for the slight bend in the shuttles path and for future vehicles that may fail to yield.",

The following vehicle was traveling approximately twice as fast as the May shuttle and catching up to the May shuttle from behind. The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s.

On April [XXX], 2023 at 10:46 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling southbound on [XXX] in the leftmost lane as it was approaching the intersection with [XXX].  The signal for traffic proceeding south on [XXX] was green for the Waymo AV as it approached the intersection.  As the Waymo AV approached, an individual riding a motorized scooter traveling north on [XXX] proceeded to turn left onto westbound [XXX], across the paths of the Waymo AV and other oncoming vehicles.  The Waymo AV began to brake, and the Waymo AV test driver transitioned to manual mode and brought the Waymo AV to a stop.  A passenger car traveling directly behind the Waymo AV then made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV.  The individual riding the scooter was not contacted by the Waymo AV or any other vehicle.  At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode.  Both the Waymo AV and the passenger car sustained damage, and the individual on the motorized scooter left the scene.

While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

The safety operator suggested that the safety driver disengage the ADS and make the turn in manual mode because the vehicle was hesitant in approaching the intersection. The safety driver disengaged the ADS, and, approximately 250ms later, subject vehicle was lightly struck from behind by a white Mazda3.  Having seen debris on the roadway, the driver and operator believed they had run over a rock and did not realize they were hit by the vehicle. After concluding the mission, the driver and operator found damage to a sensor during an inspection.  A subsequent review of video led to discovery of the crash.

While performing a multipoint turn at the north end of [XXX] (a dead-end road), the Waymo AV was in reverse at approximately 2 MPH when it made contact with the front driver's side door of an unoccupied parked passenger vehicle. The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode until just before making contact, when the test driver transitioned the Waymo AV into manual mode. The contact caused minor scuffing and a small dent in the door handle of the parked vehicle's driver door and minor damage to the plastic sensor housing on the Waymo AV's rear passenger's side.
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because the Waymo AV was towed from the scene (though the Waymo AV was driveable). Waymo may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available.",
