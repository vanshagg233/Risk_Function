On November [XXX], 2024 Waymo received notice of an allegation that a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Los Angeles, California may have been in a low-speed collision with a non-motorist (pedestrian) on [XXX] near [XXX]. 
On November [XXX], 2024 at 4:04 AM PT a Waymo AV operating in Los Angeles, California was traveling northwest on [XXX] when it began to slow to yield to a pedestrian crossing the street ahead from right to left. After the pedestrian had crossed the path of the Waymo AV, the Waymo AV began to accelerate slightly then immediately began to slow again as the pedestrian turned around and approached the Waymo AV. As the Waymo AV was slowing, the pedestrian may have made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV. 
At the time of the possible impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The pedestrian later claimed to have a minor injury.  The Waymo AV did not sustain any damage. 
Even though this event may involve intentional contact by the pedestrian and the occurrence of actual contact between the Waymo AV and the pedestrian is not clear, Waymo is reporting this event as a crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because a vulnerable road user (pedestrian) influenced the driving task of a vehicle involved and reportedly sustained a minor injury as a result of the event.

The Nuro Prius was in autonomous mode when it approached the intersection and came to a stop at the stop bar on [XXX]. It is a two-way stop with the traffic on [XXX] having right of way. The Nuro Prius nudged forward due to an occlusion.
The Nuro operator judged the nudging to be too far and disengaged autonomous mode to reverse in manual. When reversing, the operator bumped a pedestrian crossing the street behind the Nuro Prius. The pedestrian was not injured and after speaking with the operator, left the scene. There was no damage to the vehicle and law enforcement was not involved.",

A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of [XXX] across from the vehicles and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed completely through the AVs lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in front of the Nissan Sentra. Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, deflecting the pedestrian in front of the AV. The AV braked aggressively but, shortly thereafter, made contact with the pedestrian. The AV then attempted to pull over out of traffic, pulling the individual forward, rather than remaining stationary. The driver of the Nissan Sentra left the scene shortly after the collision. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene and the pedestrian was transported by EMS. On November 2, 2023, Cruise submitted a voluntary recall report to NHTSA relating to the AVs response after the collision, based on updated analysis that Cruise performed since the filing of the previous submissions.",Y
