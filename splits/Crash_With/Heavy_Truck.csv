At this time, we are not aware of any injuries, and camera footage appears to show that the box truck continued to drive. From the post-trip inspection, there was not any visible trailer damage. Before the collision, the Aurora Driver was driving straight in its lane and passing the box truck. Shortly thereafter, the box truck began to encroach into the lane of the Aurora Driver. The Aurora Driver detected the box truck's encroachment into the Aurora vehicle's lane and initiated a nudge away from the box truck to provide space. The Aurora Driver detected the collision and made the decision to initiate an incident response, but before it could execute that response, the Vehicle Operator took over control of the system and proceeded in manual. The Aurora vehicle then re-engaged in autonomy approximately two minutes later.

The vehicle's ADS determined that a truck traveling in the adjacent lane had a trajectory towards the Drive Pilot's lane, and so the Mercedes-Benz test vehicle autonomously applied the brakes to avoid a collision. After applying the brakes and bringing itself to a standstill, the Mercedes-Benz was then struck in the rear bumper by a trailing semi-truck that did not stop in time.

On May [XXX], 2022 at 3:11 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) Peterbilt Class 8 semi-truck and trailer, operating in Ennis, Texas was in a collision involving a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer on northbound Interstate [XXX] near [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode in the rightmost lane on Interstate [XXX] when a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer began to pass it in the adjacent left lane. Before the adjacent Class 8 semi-truck and trailer had fully passed the Waymo AV, it encountered tire debris in its lane, executed a right lane change, and its trailer (the right side, rear section) entered the lane in which the Waymo AV was traveling and made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV cab. The Waymo AV transitioned to manual mode and the test driver took control. The Waymo AV exited the roadway to the right shoulder of the road and came to a stop off of the roadway. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver's seating position). The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage and the third-party Class 8 semi-truck and trailer did not stop to exchange information. The Waymo AV test driver was transported for medical care and the Waymo AV software operator, seated in the passenger seat, later sought medical attention. 
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because an individual involved in the crash was transported from the scene to a hospital for medical treatment and a vehicle involved was towed away.
